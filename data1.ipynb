      "Feeling upset but don’t know why? There might be an underlying cause, such as hormonal changes, past trauma, depression, or stress. If you find yourself feeling low or crying without an obvious reason, you might wonder what’s going on. This is often nothing to worry about — you might just be feeling extra sensitive today.  In some cases, there may be a cause you haven’t thought of yet. Feeling sad is a natural part of life. In fact, sadness has some benefits, like helping us process difficult events and connect with others. But that doesn’t always make it easier in the moment. However you feel today, know that you’re not alone and there are many ways to find joy again.  People feel sad for lots of reasons — but it’s also possible to feel sad for no reason that you can think of. Sometimes, a seemingly small disappointment can affect you more than you think, leaving you upset long afterward. You might not connect your current sadness to what happened. Feeling lonely, experiencing rejection, and having relationship issues can all have a major and lasting effect on how you feel.  Even a lack of sleep or feeling hungry can put you in a sour mood some days. In other cases, there might be a deeper cause. Factors like depression, trauma, grief, and hormonal changes can affect your mood without your conscious awareness for years, yet they may affect your emotions every day. Consider setting time aside to sit with your emotions and work out what’s causing them. You may not find the answer, and that’s OK — but sometimes, finding and naming the cause can help you accept your feelings and move toward happiness. Below, we look at some reasons you might be feeling sad and tips for boosting your mood. Depression, also called major depressive disorder (MDD) or clinical depression, is characterized by a low mood and loss of interest in things you usually enjoy that lasts for at least 2 weeks. Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) reports that about 8.4% of adults in the United States have experienced depression. Other symptoms of depression include:  If you think you have depression but aren’t sure if it’s MDD, you might want to read about other types of depression, too.  A type of depression called persistent depressive disorder (PDD), or dysthymia, is depression that lasts for 2 years or more. People who experience it might not remember a time when they didn’t feel sad.  If you only feel sad for seemingly no reason during a specific part of the year, it could be a type of depression called seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or depression with seasonal features. SAD is more common during the fall and winter when days are shorter. Trauma is an emotional or physical response to one or more harmful or life threatening events or circumstances with lasting adverse effects on your mental and physical well-being, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA). Trauma can affect your brain and nervous system, and many people experience emotional dysregulation long after the traumatic situation is over.  Emotional dysregulation can look like this: If you find yourself affected by a traumatic event long after it ends — such as intrusive memories or avoiding situations that remind you of the trauma — you may be living with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or complex PTSD. Changes in your reproductive hormone levels can cause mood changes, including feeling down or upset.  In those cases, you might be unable to figure out why you’re sad because hormonal changes happen without conscious awareness. Various mood-altering issues that stem from shifting reproductive hormone levels include:  When your depression symptoms have a hormonal cause, they may ease when your hormone levels readjust, but sometimes they can linger. It’s often worth speaking with a mental health professional to help support you through these periods.  Sometimes you’ll feel sad when you’re dealing with a specific problem in your life. High levels of stress can lead to emotional dysregulation and unpredictable mood shifts in anyone. In fact, stress can have both mental and physical effects. Stressful or upsetting situations might include: Once you adjust to the change or cope with the situation, the feelings will likely go away. If you are having trouble adjusting to the situation consider speaking with a mental health professional. When you feel sad, various methods can offer relief and help you find joy again.  Sometimes people feel sad for no obvious reason, and that’s OK. The feelings often pass.  If you feel sad often, find it hard to deal with your mood, or think you have a mental health condition it can help to speak with a mental health professional. A primary care doctor can be a good first step, too.  Want to learn more about starting therapy? Psych Central’s How to Find Mental Health Support resource can help.

      "Sadness is a natural emotion that everyone experiences at various times in their life. Feeling sad for no reason may be related to hormonal changes, lack of sleep, stress, or other factors. Sadness can affect people in different ways. People may want to cry, spend time alone, or do other comfort-related activities until they feel happier. Occasional sadness is normal. However, feeling sad for more than 2 weeks, or sadness affecting everyday functioning, may indicate a more serious underlying cause, such as depression.  This article explores why a person may feel sad for no apparent reason, tips for feeling happier, and when to speak with a doctor about feeling sad.  Fluctuations in hormones can significantly affect a person’s mood and sometimes lead to unexplained sadness.  Hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle, including fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone, can affect someone’s mood each month. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is common and can make a person feel sad at the start of menstruation.  According to the Office on Women’s Health, feelings of sadness, known as the baby blues, typically last a few days after birth and occur due to hormonal fluctuations coupled with new challenges.  However, if sadness persists for longer than 2 weeks, the person may have postpartum depression. Depression after pregnancy affects 1 in 8 people that give birth. People going through puberty also experience hormonal changes, which may cause them to feel sad. These hormone shifts are a natural part of adolescence and can vary in intensity from one person to another.  Hormonal changes can cause the following symptoms: Treatment options for sadness due to hormone fluctuations may involve talk therapy, support groups, and, in some people, medication. Sleep is essential for emotional well-being. Lack of sleep can lead to feelings of worry, frustration, and anger, among other emotions.  Chronic sleep deprivation can alter brain activity and make it difficult to control emotions and cope with daily problems.  Signs that someone is not getting enough sleep may include the following: Establishing good sleep habits may help a person experiencing sadness and other mood changes due to lack of sleep. These may include: Life always has some level of stress, but sometimes, a person may experience events that cause higher levels of stress. Excessive stress can cause someone to feel unexplained sadness and other negative emotions. Signs that someone might be feeling high levels of stress include the following: The following lifestyle changes may help someone cope with stress: Grief is a natural reaction to experiencing loss. The loss may be the death of a loved one, ending a close relationship, or going through a major life change.  Having a wide range of emotions, including sadness, during this time is common.  As well as feelings of sadness, signs of grief can include: Grief may linger for a while. Here are some possible ways a person can work through grief: As the days shorten and temperatures drop, some people may experience winter blues. The change in season may bring on feelings of sadness, shortened tempers, and feelings of lethargy.  While these feelings can be temporary, some people may experience extreme sadness to the point that it becomes disabling.  Experts call this seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that lasts during the winter season and goes away during the rest of the year. Sadness due to seasonal changes may result in the following symptoms when winter arrives: The American Psychological Association recommends the following tips to cope with seasonal sadness: Unexplained sadness that lasts more than 2 weeks may be a symptom of an underlying medical condition. Mental health conditions that may cause sadness include: Mental illness can affect anyone at any age. These conditions can affect a person’s mood, thinking, and behaviors. They can also impact a person’s day-to-day living and personal relationships.  Each mental illness has unique symptoms, but here are some common generalized symptoms.  Treating mental disorders may involve talking with a professional, taking medications, and participating in therapy.  According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NAMI), self-care can help a person improve their emotional and mental well-being. The following self-care tips may help someone feel happier: Feeling sad on occasion is a normal part of life. However, a person should not ignore sadness that is persistent and unexplainable.  If someone experiences prolonged or severe sadness, they should speak with a healthcare professional.

      "Feeling sad all the time for no specific reason doesn’t always mean you have depression, but it does suggest you could be experiencing something more complex than sadness alone. Sadness is a temporary state that often has a clear cause, like a big disappointment, the loss of someone close to you, or bad news from someone you love.  This type of sadness can fluctuate throughout the day. In certain moments, the emotional burden might feel particularly heavy. You might cry often, feel numb or drained, and struggle to concentrate.  At other times — when you get lost in something you enjoy or when a loved one distracts you — your sorrow may seem light enough that you can barely feel its weight. While it might linger in some form for days or weeks, it generally begins to ease naturally. Persistent sadness is something else entirely. It can wrap around you like a heavy blanket, muffling the sensations and joy of everyday life. This sadness can leave you feeling low, empty, and defeated. You don’t know what caused your unhappiness, so you have no idea how to start feeling better. Feeling sad isn’t at all unusual. After all, sorrow is a normal human response to disappointment and loss. Sadness that doesn’t have a clear reason behind it and doesn’t seem to improve, however, may suggest something else is going on. While not everyone with depression will feel sad, unexplainable sadness you can’t seem to shake is one of the primary signs of depression.  If your sadness does relate to depression, you’ll likely feel sad nearly all of the time — almost every day, for most of each day, for a period of 2 weeks or longer. Sadness, in other words, seems to become a constant companion.  With depression, you’ll experience other symptoms, too. If several of the signs below accompany your sad or tearful mood, there’s a good chance you’re dealing with depression: Chronic sadness, especially when related to depression, might also prompt regular thoughts of death or suicide. Even if you don’t have a plan to act on these thoughts, it’s always best to talk to someone you trust and get support right away (more on how to do this later).  You might begin to notice your feelings of sadness, along with any other symptoms you experience, follow a specific pattern. Depression can take different forms, and various underlying factors can have an impact on the way your symptoms show up.  A few things to look for: People living with bipolar disorder often experience episodes of depression as part of a cycle that also includes episodes of mania or hypomania.  You might notice you suddenly feel intensely happy, even euphoric. This abrupt change in mood might also involve: This episode might last a week, or longer.  Somewhere around 40 percent of people with bipolar disorder have what’s known as mixed features. You could experience sadness and other symptoms of depression at the same time as mania.  This combination of symptoms can make it harder to understand what you’re experiencing, which could add to your distress.  Maybe your sadness seems to arrive or intensify around the same time of year the days begin to shorten. Once the longer, sunnier days of spring and summer arrive, you feel better, year after year. It’s pretty common to feel a little low in autumn and winter. The nights get long and cold, and there are plenty of days when you may not even see the sun. If this seasonal sadness persists and becomes serious enough to affect daily life, you could have seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that occurs along with seasonal changes.  Along with other common depression symptoms, you might also notice: Reproductive hormones can also play a part in depression symptoms, so tracking what time of the month symptoms show up can offer some important clues.  Symptoms of depression often become serious enough to get in the way of everyday functioning, but that isn’t always the case.  With most forms of depression, periods of sadness might last a few weeks or longer, depending on the type of depression you have, and then lift temporarily. You might not feel sad or notice any other symptoms for some time.  With persistent depressive disorder (PDD), on the other hand, mood symptoms won’t show up in clear episodes. Instead, they often last for years. With PDD, you may no longer recall a time when you didn’t feel somewhat sad or depressed. You might: Unlike symptoms of major depression, symptoms of PDD may not prevent you from living your daily life. Still, as you work, go to school, and take care of your regular responsibilities. you’ll likely notice an ever-present sad or low mood.  When sadness tints every aspect of your day-to-day an unrelenting gray, you might have trouble finding relief. Feeling down can also make it more difficult to brainstorm potentially helpful changes, which is why professional support can make a big difference (more on this in a moment).  In the meantime, these strategies may offer a bit of relief. Many of the symptoms associated with sadness or depression can prompt you to pull back from others rather than seek emotional support.  When feeling irritable, you might get frustrated with loved ones easily. You might experience guilt over negative feelings toward others, your need to cancel plans, or your disinterest in your usual activities. It’s also fairly common to find yourself doubting whether loved ones actually care about you and want to spend time with you.  Isolating yourself will generally only worsen sadness, though, so sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help a lot. Even opening up to just one close friend or family member can help you feel less alone.  Talking won’t necessarily make your symptoms go away, but it can help the burden seem lighter. You’ll also have someone you can turn to if you need additional support.  People commonly use humor as a method of coping with depression and other mental health conditions.  Even when you don’t feel much like laughing or cracking jokes, funny books, YouTube videos, or your favorite comedy program can often take the edge off your sadness and help raise your spirits.  Not a fan of comedy? Taking a beloved book off the shelf or curling up with a nostalgic movie can sometimes offer similar benefits.  Music offers a number of mental health benefits, including temporary relief from sadness and other symptoms of depression. It can help energize you, so you could also see some improvements in any fatigue you’re experiencing.  Listening to music can encourage your brain to produce hormones like dopamine and serotonin. These “happy hormones” have been linked to improvements in mood and reduced anxiety and stress. Just try to avoid music that matches your mood. Wallowing can seem like a good way to get those feelings out, but mournful tunes might end up worsening sadness or depression. Aim for upbeat music with a faster tempo.  Your favorite hobbies may seem less enjoyable when you feel sad or down, but giving them a try anyway can sometimes offer mood-boosting benefits.  If you’re struggling to muster up any energy, try low-key activities instead of ones that you feel exhausted just thinking about. A few possibilities:  “Have you tried going outside?” can sound like something a well-meaning loved one with no real knowledge of mood disorders might say. Yet while sunlight won’t completely cure feelings of sadness or depression, regular sun exposure can make a difference for both physical and mental well-being. Experts believe sunlight prompts your brain to produce serotonin. When you have lower levels of this hormone in your system, you’re more likely to feel depressed, especially as fall and winter roll around. Spending more time in the sun, then, can increase serotonin and potentially relieve sadness.  Exercise can also offer some mood-boosting benefits, so if you feel up to it, combine your sun exposure with a walk around your neighborhood or in your favorite park. Can’t get outside easily? Little sun to speak of? Light therapy with a SAD lamp can help you get some artificial sun that still offers very real benefits.  Coping strategies won’t always help relieve sadness. If nothing seems to help you find relief, it may be time to talk to a therapist or other healthcare professional. Professional support is always recommended when symptoms: It’s important to get help right away if you have thoughts of death, dying, or suicide. Therapy offers a safe space to address and manage these thoughts over the long term, but in-the-moment support may be more helpful if you’re experiencing distressing thoughts during a mental health crisis. You can find a therapist in your area with a quick Google search, using a therapist directory, or by asking a primary care provider for a referral. When talking with a healthcare professional, be sure to tell them about any patterns you’ve noticed with your symptoms, including seasonal mood changes or cycles between extreme sadness and extreme elation. Also, consider keeping track of changing moods and emotions in a journal. This helps express and sort through feelings at the moment, but it also creates a log of symptoms you can share with your care team. Feeling sad all the time for no specific reason doesn’t always mean you have depression, but it does suggest you could be experiencing something more complex than sadness alone. When sadness lingers and becomes more of a fixed state of being, talking to a therapist can have a lot of benefits. In the meantime, be gentle with yourself and try to remember that this feeling won’t last forever. Crystal Raypole has previously worked as a writer and editor for GoodTherapy.

      " We all have days where we feel down and sometimes feeling sad can happen for no apparent reason. Occasionally, sadness is natural but other times it isn’t and perhaps it is a symptom of depression. The good news is that there are plenty of useful tools available for people living with unexplained sadness. One of our psychologists Dr Jessica Valentine explains the possible reasons behind feeling sad and what you can do to make yourself feel better.  It is normal to feel low and not understand where it is coming from. Sometimes we have memories that have been deep rooted from our childhood or a painful situation that you might have blocked out. People feel low for various reasons. I know that I feel low in the wintertime because there isn’t enough sun. I manage this through diet, exercise, meditation and travelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling low after a loss, a breakup, or ‘for no reason at all’ is all normal. When you work with a psychologist like myself, we can piece all of the information together to find out what is ‘triggering’ you to feel this way. Often people feel low because they are not happy in their life or can feel like their life is mundane. We can help restore the balance in your life using a few simple techniques.\n",
      "  A sudden low mood or sadness can be a sign of depression. There are various types of depression. Someone could be feeling melancholy, which is feeling low without knowing why or on the other side of the spectrum someone could have symptoms of severe depression which could have been a result of having trauma in one's life. I have had clients who had been feeling low because they had a vitamin deficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, anxiety can play a huge role in depression. We might feel anxious, shame or guilt ourselves and then we feel ‘bad’ about it. This is how depression plays a role in anxiety and when someone has mixed episodes with anxiety and depression. This is why it is so important to understand how mindfulness works. Mindfulness works by being aware of your own body, being aware of others around you and focusing on your body’s breathing and sensations.\n",
      "  Depression and sadness are different. Sadness is a symptom of depression. Other symptoms of depression are anger, frustration, avoidance and the feeling of being stuck. Not everyone will have similar symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is normal or ‘atypical’ to feel sad sometimes. Other feelings such as anger, happiness, frustration, annoyance or agitation are all okay to feel. Sometimes when we have strong feelings or emotions it can affect our personal relationships, work, and home life. This is when we need to learn other ways to handle or deal with these emotions in a healthier, proactive kind of way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DSM-V Psychological Diagnostic manual recognises nine categories of depression. The areas of depression that someone might fall under would be major depression, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorder, psychotic depression, postpartum depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, situational depression and atypical depression. Each one of these categories has its own unique symptoms.\n",
      "  Some symptoms of depression could include:\n",
      "    When you feel sad or low three tips to increase your vibrations are:\n",
      "  Exercising or going for a walk will make you feel happier. \n",
      "  By taking high doses of omega oils and vitamin B complex one can naturally boost their nervous system to give it more support on those days when you are feeling low. \n",
      "  By meditating 10 minutes a day on a weekly intention this will give you the guidance and internal self-help that you might need.\n",

      "Everyone feels sad sometimes, just like everyone can feel joyful, angry, proud and plenty of other emotions. In other words, everyone has feelings, and those feelings are always changing. Sometimes we feel happy (such as when we’re having fun) and sometimes we feel sad (such as when we lose a loved one). Whatever the feelings, it is real and part of living.  A negative emotion may even help you. Our world focuses on happiness and treats unhappiness as an unnecessary or useless feeling. But sadness can slow you down, and make you really think about your life, your feelings and the people around you. It can help you keep sight of your relationships and dreams.  In other words, being sad doesn’t mean you are not coping with a situation. Rather, it helps you come to terms with that situation and move on. It is an important emotion that can help you adapt, accept, focus, persevere and grow. And there’s more good news: you can learn to manage your sadness.  We use different words to talk about sadness: agony, anguish, broken heart, hurt, sorrow, dejection, dismay, homesickness, distress, unhappiness and more. All these emotions can occur in response to a negative or unexpected situations, or life changes.   Sadness often occurs at the same time as other feelings, such as anger, stress, guilt, grief, anxiety or hopelessness. Sometimes, the other feeling may be so strong that you don’t realise you are sad. \n",
      "So what does sadness feel like? It may change how you feel physically. Perhaps you have a stomach ache or a headache, or you can’t sleep.  Sadness may also change how you feel emotionally. Perhaps you are teary, grumpy, bored or frustrated, or just keen to avoid other people.  But recognising your sadness, and understanding that it is okay to feel sad, is a sign of a stable sense of wellbeing.  Life is full of situations that may make people feel sad: When you face these situations, you may have unhelpful or negative thoughts about your sadness. And those thoughts can make you feel worse.  So, try a different approach: try to acknowledge your sadness and the situation that prompted it. And give yourself time to deal with any problems and feel better. You also may want to call on resources that could help you (such as friends and family, a psychologist, or another health professional). Feeling better can involve taking one step or many. It may happen quickly or over a long time. Just remember that emotions ebb and flow, and you can move through sadness to a more positive emotion. First, acknowledge that you are feeling sad. Sometimes sadness may feel manageable, and acknowledging how you feel is enough – after all, it will pass over time. Sometimes you might want to actively do something to help manage your sadness. You may want to try some of these tips: Maybe you know someone else who is feeling sad. Being supportive isn't always easy, because it’s sometimes hard to know why someone is sad and how they are coping.  Here are four basic tips: For more ideas about how to support someone who is sad, read the tips from  beyondblueExternal Link  . Feeling sad does not mean you have depression. But if your mood starts to interrupt your life and how you function, then you may have become depressed.  Key differences between sadness and clinical depression relate to the cause for the change in mood and how long you have felt that way, and other symptoms that might be present.  If your mood relates to a recent event, such as a relationship breakup, then you may well be feeling sadness. But if that breakup was months ago, or you can see no clear reason for your change in mood, you could be depressed, and it might be helpful for you to chat to your GP about what’s causing you to feel the way you do.

Please log in to your account Depression is the most common mental illness in the U.S., with 6.7% of all adults who have experienced a major depressive episode. Unfortunately, depression extends to teens and young users as well, and researchers observed an increasing rate in the recent years (from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014 in adolescents and from 8.8% to 9.6% in young adults), especially among girls and women. People themselves are a barrier to fight this disease as they tend to hide their symptoms and do not receive treatments.

      "Depression is a complex medical condition. It can affect every aspect of a person’s life, from their personal relationships to their physical health. And of course, it impacts mental wellbeing.  But being unhappy isn’t the same as being depressed. Depression is a term often used loosely to describe how people feel after a bad week at work or when they’re going through a breakup. Clinical depression, also known as major depressive disorder, is more than feeling blue. Specific symptoms differentiate depression from the type of generalized sadness all people sometimes experience. In 2021, at least 8.3% of U.S. adults experienced a major depressive episode. Depression has become one of the most common mental health disorders in the country. In this article we cover eight signs of depression. The symptoms of depression tend to be more pervasive, severe, and debilitating for non-white individuals, who are more likely to be under-diagnosed or misdiagnosed when they have depression. Many do not get treated for the condition, and their symptoms grow even more intense as they get older. Research suggests that American Indians, Native Americans and Alaska Natives are the most likely to develop psychiatric disorders, including depression. This group lives with an enormous amount of post-traumatic stress, and members are more likely to engage in substance use disorders than people in other communities. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people (ages 8 to 24) in this demographic.Additional research suggests that white people are more likely to experience depression during their lifetimes (17.9% prevalence) than African-American individuals (10.4%). (Other data counters this, and finds that the latter group is more likely to experience depression, especially as its members age.) Socioeconomic factors, interpersonal issues, and concerns about racism tend to be major drivers of mental health for Black individuals.Depression is found to be less common among Asians, and more common among Hispanics and Latinx people.  The signs of depression may differ between racial and ethnic groups. Understanding these differences can help people and their healthcare professionals better identify and treat the condition. Determining whether persistent dark feelings are the result of depression can be the first step toward healing and recovery. The following signs indicate that it’s time to see a mental health professional. People who are depressed often experience feelings of hopelessness, though this is not the same across all races and ethnicities. Hispanic and Latino individuals are the most likely to report feeling hopeless “all or most of the time,” followed by people of two or more races, according to a recent National Health Interview Survey. Sometimes people who are depressed feel like they are worthless, a sentiment that the survey found most common among people of two or more races, as well as American Indians and Alaska Natives. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are most likely to feel like “everything is an effort, all the time,” followed by Black or African-American individuals. Some people who live with depression also experience inappropriate guilt. They may often think, “It’s all my fault,” or “What’s the point?” Loneliness and isolation are among the top three reasons people describe themselves as having poor mental health, as reported by more than 1 million people who screened themselves for depression and anxiety on Mental Health America’s website in 2020. For Hispanic/Latinx people, it was cited as the biggest cause of mental health issues. Depression can take the pleasure or enjoyment out of the things people love. A loss of interest in or withdrawal from activities that were previously looked forward to — sports, hobbies, going out with friends — is frequently a sign of major depression. In 2020, a whopping 90% of people who identified with more than one race reported symptoms of depression to Mental Health America. Another study of 25,503 older Americans found that Black and Hispanic individuals were 1.5 to 2 times more likely than white people to experience sadness and a loss of interest in everyday life. Losing interest in sex is common. Symptoms of major depression include a decreased sex drive and even impotence. Learn more about types of depression, symptoms, and causes. Part of the reason that people living with depression might stop doing things they enjoy is because they feel very tired. Depression often comes with a lack of energy and an overwhelming feeling of fatigue, which can be among its most debilitating symptoms. This can lead to excessive sleeping. Asian and Pacific Islander people (particularly those from older age groups) may report feeling tired or sleepy rather than depressed, as the latter can be seen as less culturally acceptable. Because these symptoms can be attributed to other conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, healthcare professionals may miss the true cause. Depression is also linked to insomnia, and they can feed off each other. A lack of restful sleep may lead to anxiety. Depression and anxiety often occur together. Symptoms of anxiety can include:  Native Americans and American Indians were most likely to report high levels of anxiety in Mental Health America’s 2020 screenings. Their rate of moderate to severe depression also increased sharply after 2019.  Depression can affect the sexes differently. Research shows that men with depression may also experience irritability, escapist or risky behavior, substance abuse, or misplaced anger. Overall, men are less likely than women to recognize depression or seek treatment for that condition. They are more likely to get help when their symptoms resemble “traditional” depression but may not identify their irritability or other strong feelings as something requiring treatment, according to a 2018 study.  Women are about twice as likely to take antidepressant medication as men, with the most frequent users being those over 60, according to the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. White people are also far more likely to take antidepressants than Black, Hispanic, or Asian individuals. Men, for their part, prefer medicine to talk therapy when they get treatment, a 2020 studyfound.  Weight and appetite can fluctuate for people with depression. This experience may be different for each person. Some people will have an increased appetite and gain weight, while others won’t be hungry and will lose weight.  One indication of whether dietary changes are related to depression is if they’re intentional or not. If they’re not, it may mean that they’re caused by depression. One moment it’s an outburst of anger. The next, tears are flowing uncontrollably. Depression can cause mood swings that fluctuate wildly, and it has nothing to do with anything outside of the person experiencing them.  Depression is sometimes connected to suicide. In 2020, nearly 46,000 people died from suicide in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Black people are less likely to die by suicide than white people, but Black teenagers are more likely to attempt suicide than white teenagers. Statisticians were surprised to note a significant decrease in the number of people who died by suicide in 2019 and 2020, after years of increases. In 2020 alone, the number of white females who died by suicide dropped 10%, while the number of white males doing so decreased 3%. The number of Asian men dying by suicide also dropped in 2020.At the same time, some groups saw increases. In 2020, the number of Hispanic men dying by suicide rose 5%, while the number of Black and American Indian men dying this way also rose. According to the CDC, American Indian and Native American people are far more likely to die by suicide than any other group, followed by white people. In Mental Health America’s online screenings, 46% of American Indians and Native Americans reported thinking about suicide or self-harm in 2020, and the number of those having such thoughts increased 7.5% over 2019. This reflected the largest jump in suicidal ideation from any racial or ethnic group surveyed. Those who die by suicide usually show symptoms of depression or mental health issues first. Often people will talk about it or make a first attempt before succeeding in ending their lives. When people are at immediate risk of self-harm or hurting others, those around them should: Depression affects millions of people, but there are myriad options available for treatment, from lifestyle changes to medications. No matter what path one follows, asking for professional help is a critical first step toward starting to feel better. What that help looks like may differ across communities of color and other marginalized groups. Because “traditional” depression symptoms can vary by race and ethnicity — and some people are reluctant to report their symptoms — often, individuals in these communities go undiagnosed.The reasons for anxiety and depression in each community also differ, and they are not static. In Mental Health America’s 2020 screenings, white people said coronavirus played the biggest role in negatively affecting their mental health. But Black people cited financial matters as a primary concern, while Hispanic/Latinx people were deeply affected by loneliness/isolation, and Native Americans impacted by trauma, loss, and relationship issues (also a major concern for Asian or Pacific Islanders). People in these racial and ethnic groups are typically less likely to be screened for depression and don’t receive mental healthcare treatment as often as those who are white.  Healthcare professionals who work with people experiencing depression must tailor their approach to address differences among those of varying ethnicities and races. Using a cultural accommodation model(CAM) may help bridge the gap. CAM helps these professionals adjust their viewfinder when diagnosing and treating conditions, urging them to be more culturally appropriate and sensitive to the unique characteristics of these populations.

      "While everyone has experienced sadness, not everyone has experienced depression. In fact, if you’ve never been depressed, chances are that you don’t have a real grasp on what living with this complex mental illness is like. Depression is insidious. It affects not only your mood, but also your ability to feel, think, and function. It blunts sensations of pleasure, closes off connectedness, stifles creativity, and, at its worst, shuts down hope. It also often causes deep emotional pain not only to the person experiencing it, but to that person’s close family and friends. If sadness alone isn’t a good gauge of depression, what is? According to the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which is the diagnostic guide used by most mental health professionals, if you’ve experienced at least five of the following symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD), also known as clinical depression. No one knows for sure why some people become depressed and others do not. Depression can occur spontaneously, without any obvious cause. And it’s well documented that once you’ve had one depressive episode, your risk of having another later in life increases. Psychiatrists today generally look at depression in “bio-psycho-social” terms, meaning that they see it as a complex disorder most likely triggered by overlapping biological, psychological, and social (also referred to as environmental) factors, according to a study published in August 2019 in Psychiatric Times. Among the potential contributors to depression are: To be diagnosed with MDD, one of your symptoms must be a persistent low mood or a loss of interest or pleasure, the DSM-5 states. Your symptoms must also not be due to substance abuse or a medical condition, such as thyroid problems, a brain tumor, or a nutritional deficiency. Of course, it’s normal to have any or all of these symptoms temporarily (for hours or even days) from time to time. The difference with depression is that the symptoms persist and make it difficult to function normally. If you suspect you may be depressed, the best first step is to reach out to your primary care doctor, a psychiatrist, or a psychotherapist. Also, know that depression screenings may now be a part of routine checkups. As of June 2023, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that primary care providers screen all adults for depression, including pregnant and postpartum people and older adults. If you’re reluctant to consult a professional, type “depression” or “clinical depression” into Google on your cellphone or computer and you’ll find links to a clinically validated depression test known as the PHQ-9 patient health questionnaire. Although designed to be administered by a healthcare professional, this test is short and straightforward. Take it and you can immediately see if your score indicates you may have depression. Important: If you suspect you have depression, or if you’re feeling troubled by your symptoms, have suicidal thoughts, just need to talk, want some advice, or need a referral for treatment, call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) at the three-digit code 988, or the National Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Both are free and available 24/7, 365 days a year. Learn More About Depression Symptoms In addition to MDD, there are several other kinds of depression, including: Learn More About Perinatal Depression Learn More About SAD Learn More About Bipolar Disorder Learn More About Postpartum Depression One reason depression can be hard to identify is that its signs can vary widely from person to person and sometimes be masked by atypical symptoms. For example, some people who are depressed may show it by acting disgruntled, resentful, or irritable. In fact, aggression — including outright acts of violence — can be indicative of “hidden” depression, according to a report published in February 2017 in Psychiatric Times. Depression masquerading as anger may seem surprising at first, but not when you consider that several underlying factors, including alcohol or substance abuse and childhood trauma, have been linked to both. Similarly, although it’s not clear why, a person who experiences anxiety is at high risk for developing depression, and vice versa. The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports that as many as 60 percent of people with anxiety will also have symptoms of depression; the same goes for people with depression having symptoms of anxiety. Experts say there is often a genetic predisposition for these co-occurring disorders, according to Hartgrove Behavioral Health System. Depression may also manifest psychosomatically, meaning that instead of presenting first and foremost as a mood disorder, the dominant symptom may be things like vague aches, dizziness, headaches, digestive problems, or back pain, according to a review published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Complicating matters is that it’s often hard to know whether depression is causing the physical symptoms, or if the physical symptoms are causing depression. How long depression lasts varies from person to person, but according to the DSM-5, a depressive episode lasts at least two weeks. Untreated depressive episodes appear to last 6 to 12 months, according to StatPearls. Depression also tends to be chronic, with episodes happening again in about half of people who’ve experienced one depressive episode, 70 percent of people who’ve had two episodes, and 90 percent of people who’ve had three episodes. But some people never experience another episode after the first one. If you suspect that depression is interfering with your life, talking about what you’re experiencing and discussing treatment options with a medical professional is essential. As actress Taraji P. Henson, who describes her depression as “suffocating” darkness, recently explained in an interview with Self, “When you’re quiet, things aren’t fixed. It gets worse.” The good news is that there’s abundant evidence that people with depression who seek treatment will find significant relief from talk therapy (psychotherapy), medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination of all efforts, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. The Society of Clinical Psychology rates several types of psychotherapy as highly effective treatments for depression: The most commonly prescribed antidepressants cause changes in brain chemistry that affect how neurons communicate. Exactly how this improves mood remains somewhat of a mystery, but the fact that they do often work is well-established. If you’re thinking about trying antidepressants, talk to your doctor about whether these treatments could be right for you. All antidepressants can have side effects, but some may be more problematic than others. You may need to try several different medications, or a combination, guided by your doctor, before you find what works best for you. In addition, it may take some patience before you see results. The full benefits of the drugs may not be realized until you’ve taken them for as long as three months, according to the the STAR*D trial, the largest, longest study on antidepressant treatment, which ended in 2006. Sometimes, other medications may be added to your regimen, depending on the form of depression, severity of your symptoms, and your response to other therapies. These might include a mood stabilizer, such as lithium (sold under several brand names) or valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote). If symptoms of psychosis (having delusions or seeing or hearing voices that are not real, for example) are present, a doctor may prescribe an antipsychotic medication, such as haloperidol (Haldol), risperidone (Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify), and olanzapine (Zyprexa). Some experts believe that using an antipsychotic in combination with an antidepressant may be more effective for depressive disorders than antidepressants alone, according to a review published in Shanghai Archives of Psychiatry. Learn More About Depression Treatment Lifestyle changes, such as making art, journaling, exercising more, and practicing yoga or mindfulness, can also alleviate depression and the stress that can heighten it. Alternative treatments like massage, acupuncture, and light therapy may also help. Diet changes, too, can uplift your mood by reducing inflammation and helping to ensure your brain gets the nutrients it needs to function at its best. One small randomized controlled study, published October 9, 2019, in the journal PLoS One, found that self-reported symptoms of depression dropped significantly in just three weeks in young adults who changed from a highly processed, high-carbohydrate diet to a Mediterranean diet focused on vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, unsweetened dairy, nuts and seeds, olive oil, and the spices turmeric and cinnamon. In contrast, the depression scores didn’t budge in a control group of people who didn’t change their diet. No, but it’s easy to see why some people might think so, because of a medical condition called antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), which can occur if you abruptly stop taking medication rather than tapering off as is generally advised. ADS is marked by a wide range of responses, including but not limited to flu-like symptoms, insomnia, worsening mood, and stomach distress, according to a report published March 11, 2019, in Psychiatric Times. Current estimates are that up to 40 percent of patients who’ve taken an antidepressant for at least a month will experience ADS symptoms if they abruptly stop their medication instead of lowering their dose gradually, according to a study published December 2018 in The American Journal of Psychiatry. (Conversely, more than 60 percent of patients who stop taking an SSRI will have no significant symptoms.) Tapering under the care of a doctor can prevent ADS by allowing the brain to adjust to changes in neurotransmitter levels. More to the point, while you should slowly stop your antidepressant with the help of your doctor, antidepressants do not cause dependence and withdrawal like other substances. Unlike substances that are known to cause addiction, such as alcohol, opioids, and barbiturates, people don't crave antidepressants. You don’t get “high” from them, and they aren’t intentionally or compulsively overused. Serious reactions like the seizures and agitation that can follow sudden withdrawal from addictive substances are “unheard of when these antidepressants are tapered gradually,” note the authors of the Psychiatric Times report. If you’ve tried at least two different antidepressants and your depression hasn’t improved, you may be diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). TRD is a serious condition that has been highly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Thirty percent of people with TRD attempt suicide in their lifetime, more than double the rate of their treatment-responsive peers, according to a review published in April 2018 in the Journal of Affective Disorders. It is not, however, a hopeless condition. A number of alternative treatment approaches are available, including: If you’re wondering how to prevent depression, unfortunately there’s no surefire way. But according to Mayo Clinic, these steps could help: Try your best to curb stress in your life. Depression can worsen and take a significant toll on your mental and physical health if it’s not properly treated, according to Mayo Clinic. Potential complications of depression include: Unfortunately, there are plenty of people who know exactly what it means to be depressed. In 2020, an estimated 21 million, or 8.4 percent, of adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in the past year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, making it one of the most common mental illnesses in the United States. What’s more, a recent report from Mental Health America, a nonprofit founded in 1909, offers startling statistics pertaining to one of depression's most disturbing symptoms: thoughts of suicide. According to its 2023 State of Mental Health in America report, suicidal ideation among adults has reached 4.84 percent (more than 12.1 million people). There is a bright side. Although there is no one-size-fits-all cure for depression, there are many effective treatment options, one of which is bound to help you heal if you’re struggling with the illness. This cannot be emphasized enough, given that roughly two-thirds of people living with depression do not receive the care they need, according to a report published online February 22, 2019, in the journal Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment. When it comes to depression, there is a distinct gender gap. Depression is nearly twice as common in women as in men, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Hormonal and other biological factors play a role in this disparity. After all, only cisgender women and people with a uterus can have premenstrual or postpartum depression. The same is true of antepartum (or perinatal) depression — depression during pregnancy — which the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimates affects 1 in 10 pregnant women. Research on depression within communities of color has revealed a number of differences in the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment between people of color and white communities. The symptoms of depression may appear differently among people of color compared with white people, according to the study from February 2019 in Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment. For instance, while white people are more likely to have acute depressive episodes, African American people are more likely to experience depression that’s more chronic, prolonged, and debilitating. In another study, published in December 2022 in Nursing Research, which was focused primarily on Black and African American mothers, participants were more likely to report self-blame, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and an inability to experience pleasure than some of the hallmark symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness or sadness. Importantly, the authors of the study noted, traditional depression screening tools may not capture these symptoms, meaning depression may go undetected in some Black and African American women. Among Black and Hispanic people, major depression goes undiagnosed and is undertreated at a much greater rate than among white people, according to a report published in May 2022 by Blue Cross Blue Shield. When these communities do receive treatment, prescription medication and counseling are utilized less often than in white communities, the report noted. When it comes to treatment, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities are the least likely racial group to seek professional mental health services, according to Mental Health America. That’s often due to factors like a lack of accessible resources, language barriers, and cultural stigmas surrounding mental health issues. Learn More About Suicide Risk and Prevention When your provider evaluates you for depression, it’s important that they rule out any other potential conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Conditions that may overlap with MDD, according to StatPearls, include: Importantly, some people may have at least one of the above conditions in addition to depression, according to research published in February 2015 in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Having multiple mental health conditions at the same time is what’s known as psychiatric comorbidity.

      "Learn about the symptoms of different mental health conditions and what you can do to tackle them. What do I do if I feel sad? Sadness can be a difficult emotion to deal with. It can be the result of loss, helplessness, or disappointment, among many other things. Sadness is one of the most common and natural human emotions, however sometimes it is possible for sadness to deepen, and this may be a sign that you are suffering from a form of depression. If you feel as though you are increasingly sad, and feel like your sadness is difficult to explain, this information on depression may help.  Interested in learning more? You can also check out our practical, self-paced online program that teaches step-by-step strategies for tackling symptoms of depression.  It is normal to experience feelings of sadness and despair in response to life events such as loss, major life changes, stress, or disappointment. In most cases, the sad feelings resolve as you come to terms with the changes in your life. In situations such as loss, these feelings may persist for months and return at significant times, such as birthdays and anniversaries related to the lost loved one. However, if you have times when you can enjoy things, this sadness is not a sign of depression.  Depression is a disorder that is characterised by excessive sadness, loss of interest in enjoyable things, and low motivation.  Depression is common. One in three people will experience an episode of major depression at some stage in their lives. While most cases of depression are mild, about one in ten people will have a moderate or severe episode.  Any of these features may be warning signs of depression. You need to be experiencing at least five of these symptoms for at least two weeks to be considered as having a depressive disorder. Remember, only a qualified mental health professional can diagnose depression following a thorough assessment of your personal situation and circumstances. If you’re concerned about the way you’ve been feeling, please don’t delay speaking with your regular healthcare provider. You can also check out our anonymous online test and see if one of our online programs could help.  Not Sure Whether to Seek Help?

No one knows exactly what causes depression. Genetic factors are important in many cases of depression, where depression seems to run in families (as do other mood disorders), and about 30% of the vulnerability for depression is due to  genetic influences.   Stressful life events  also play a part in depression. Ongoing conflicts with others can take their toll on our wellbeing, as can other social and environmental stressors such as financial difficulties, retirement, unemployment, childbirth, loneliness, or loss of someone or something important. In vulnerable people, these stressful life events may be enough to cause or worsen depression.  Personality style is another important factor. When people are depressed, they usually have a very negative view of themselves and the world. They do not appreciate good things, and bad things seem overwhelming. Some people have a tendency to view themselves and the world this way even when they are not depressed. In other words, they may have a depressive personality style.  Other possible causes of depression that should not be overlooked is  physical illness or medications. Glandular fever, influenza, hepatitis, thyroid hormones, anaemia, diabetes, birth control pills, alcohol and substances of abuse, or certain medications such as those for heart or blood pressure conditions, may all cause symptoms of depression.  There are a range of ways to deal with depression, and often they are best used in conjunction with each other. The top medical options are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), antidepressant medication, and in some severe cases, Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT).  Psychoeducation is also important when learning to manage your depression.   Take a look below to find out more about each option:  Psychoeducation refers to learning about the way depression develops and is maintained. Education for people with depression is extremely valuable. Education provides a knowledge base that can give the person greater control over their disorder. Greater control in turn may lead to reduced feelings of helplessness and an increased sense of wellbeing. Providing education for families or carers is also very important to help increase the support and assistance they provide to the person.  The most essential pieces of information for a person with a depression are that depression is a common disorder and that effective treatments are available. It is important to remember:  CBT is a proven treatment for depression, alone or in conjunction with medication. CBT is very effective and 80% of people with mild, moderate or severe depression improve. CBT involves learning to:   CBT will often be recommended when:    Click here to see if our online CBT course can help you tackle your depression to improve the way you feel.  For some people, antidepressant medication will be the first line of treatment for the elimination of severe depression, however it would be unadvisable to manage very severe depression without a trial of medication. For mild to moderate depression, antidepressant medications are not often recommended as a first line of treatment.  Different antidepressant medications work in different ways. You may need to trial more than one type to find the medication that works best for you. Make sure to keep in close contact with your prescribing physician during the early stages of taking medications as the side effects can often be difficult to deal with.  Some things to remember when taking antidepressant medications are:  ECT is an effective form of treatment for depression, especially if: ECT involves the application of a brief electric current to carefully selected sites on the scalp. These electric currents, which are administered by a psychiatrist and anaesthetist, produce a minor seizure in the brain. Prior to the procedure, the person is given a short-acting general anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant to reduce awareness of the procedure and to prevent a physical seizure. Although many people are fearful of ECT, this technique is arguably the safest and most effective medical treatment for severe depression, although there can be some memory related side effects. ECT works more quickly than antidepressant drugs and CBT.  You can also use antidepressants and CBT alongside ECT, as they can help prevent relapse after ECT is completed. What is CBT? Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or CBT is one of the most effective psychological treatments for depression. CBT uses cognitive and behavioural strategies to help target the thoughts, feelings and behaviours associated with depression. All of our online programs use CBT strategies.   Click below to see if our online CBT program can help you tackle your depression to improve the way you feel.  People who are depressed generally have a negative thinking style. They often think of themselves as worthless and that the world is bad or unfair, and they have little hope that their lives will improve in the future.  When something bad happens, people with depression often blame themselves, but when good things happen, they tell themselves they are just lucky. They are also less likely to recognise and appreciate positive events when they happen, and instead are more tuned into the bad things in their lives and brood over those events.  The cognitive strategies in CBT can help people identify and correct this biased way of thinking. These strategies identify and challenge sometimes hidden assumptions and beliefs, and can reframe the way they think about life. When people with depression are able to reframe their thoughts, they are able to recover from failures more effectively and recognise and take credit for the good things in their lives. Having these skills has been shown to reduce relapse and a recurrence of depression.  A key feature of depression is low activity. People with depression do less than they normally would, and feel worse because of this. Behavioural strategies for depression aim to identify and change behaviours such as low activity that may worsen depression.  One of the advantages of this strategy is that once acquired, these new behaviours can be applied throughout life, and help to prevent relapse. Behavioural strategies for depression include:  The symptoms of depression can be addressed to help you feel better. Here are some ways to deal with some individual symptoms: Eat small portions of food that you particularly like. Take your time and do not feel under pressure to finish if you are eating with others. Drink plenty of fluids. Seek nonsexual activities with your partner that you still enjoy. Explain to your partner that your loss of interest and affection is a symptom of your depression, not a rejection of him or her, and that these symptoms will be temporary. Get up at the same time every morning and avoid napping during the day. Across the day, expose yourself to natural sunlight and reduce tea and coffee intake if excessive (no more than two or three cups per day, and none after about 4:00 p.m.). At night, do not lie in bed awake for more than 30 minutes, and instead get out of bed and find a relaxing activity such as reading or listening to music to do until you feel tired again.  Put your worry to a useful purpose. Pick out one or two of your problems that worry you and make a decision to resolve them (you may like to ask a friend to help you).  For each of these problems, try go through the following steps:  Negative thoughts and feelings can make you focus your attention on things you do not like about yourself or your life situation. You can also underestimate positive characteristics and your ability to solve problems. These thoughts tend to make your problems seem worse than they really are.   A number of strategies may help you achieve a more balanced view of things:  Interested in learning more?

      "Many lifestyle changes can help ease the burden of living with depression. Strategies that work for one person may not be right for another, so trial and error is typical. Depression can be severe and life-altering, affecting the quality of life and the happiness of those who live with it. It’s also a common condition. It affects about 18.4% of people in the United States every year. Some common techniques may help with managing the symptoms of depression.

Even if cutting it out completely isn’t realistic for your lifestyle, limiting social media time can help prevent depression. You can do this by: Having a strong support system and an active social life is important for our mental health. Research has shown that a lack of social support can contribute to worsening depression symptoms. Make sure that you’re regularly connecting with friends and family, even when your lives are busy. Attending social events when you can and finding new hobbies that could help you meet new people can all help you build new relationships, too.  Have you ever walked into a cereal aisle and been suddenly unsure which one you wanted to buy? Researchers think that having too many choices can actually cause significant stress that can lead to depression.  The psychologist Barry Schwartz, author of the book “The Paradox of Choice,” describes research that shows that when faced with too many choices, those who aim to make the best possible choice — “maximizers” — face higher rates of depression.  For many of us, our lives are filled with choices. Which outfit do we wear, and should we buy yogurt, eggs, bagels, English muffins, or sausage for breakfast? The pressure of making the right — or wrong — choice is thought to contribute to depression. If making choices stresses you out, simplify things. You can: Chronic stress is one of the most avoidable common causes of depression. Learning how to manage and cope with stress is essential to improve mental health.  To manage stress, you can: Stress can be one of the trickiest causes of depression to manage.

One study from 2012 found that negative social interactions were linked to higher levels of two proteins known as cytokines. These two proteins are associated with inflammation, as well as depression. Research has shown that regularly consuming a high fat diet can have effects similar to those of chronic stress when it comes to causing depression. In addition, an unhealthy diet can also deprive your body of vital nutrients it needs to maintain physical and mental health.  To minimize the chances of worsening depression with your diet, consider: If a doctor has given you specific diet guidelines for your health situation, be sure to follow those.  Weight fluctuations due to stress and depression can result in low self-esteem, especially once you start adding in the judgments and criticisms of other people — for many, this can become a vicious cycle. Public health experts have found a clear correlation between being overweight or underweight and experiencing depression.  Exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and eating well should help with maintaining a healthy weight. If you’re finding it difficult to manage your weight as a result of depression, consider speaking with a doctor or therapist.  People with other chronic conditions have a higher chance of developing depression. Chronic conditions aren’t something that can be avoided, but in many cases, it may be possible to manage them.

      " There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction.

      "Sadness can be a difficult emotion to manage, but there are plenty of situations where feeling that way is a perfectly natural reaction—like when you’ve run into a setback or lost an important relationship. But when you’re feeling sad on a regular basis and you aren’t sure why, that can be a sign that your mental health needs attention.  So how can you tell if what you’re experiencing is normal (even if unpleasant) sadness or an issue that needs addressing? Read on for some key differences to look for, plus tips for handling sadness whenever it happens.  Even sadness you can’t explain can be a healthy reaction to your situation. For example, sadness can be your way of responding to a problem you haven’t consciously noticed yet. But once you start feeling down, you look for the issue (and ideally, find a solution too).  Surprisingly, research shows that sadness can even improve your relationships with other people. Being in a bad mood can even make you more persuasive and less judgmental. Looking for a good example of how sadness can be beneficial? Talkiatry therapist Tracey Griffin has a movie recommendation for you. \"Inside Out does a wonderful job of showing how sadness can make people more empathetic,\" Tracey says. \"I often use this example to help my patients see how sharing their sadness with other people can actually strengthen their connection.\" But healthy sadness tends to subside after a few hours or days, once you’ve solved or accepted the issue that’s bothering you. Persistent sadness, on the other hand, can be a sign of a mental health concern.  Clinical depression can come in a few different forms. Major depressive disorder (MDD), often (but not always) causes near-constant sadness for more than two weeks at a time. That low mood might go away for a while, but it always comes back.  If you always seem to feel sad in the winter months but your mood brightens with the weather, you might have a different type of depression: seasonal affective disorder (SAD). On the other hand, persistent depressive disorder (PDD) causes year-round, but milder gloominess.  Apart from sadness, you’ll recognize all types of depression by these symptoms:  If you’re relating to this as you read, it might be a good idea to reach out to a psychiatrist who can help you manage your symptoms.  Unlike depression, bipolar disorder doesn’t just bring you down emotionally and physically. Instead, periods of persistent sadness alternate with spells of intense happiness. You might get a brief breather from your symptoms in between episodes, or you might feel depressed and euphoric at the same time.  During a depressive episode, you’ll see the same kinds of symptoms that normally come along with clinical depression. You’ll recognize a manic episode by these symptoms:  If any of this sounds like you, consider reaching out to a psychiatrist for help.  Sometimes, a consistently down mood can be a side effect of a significant shift in your body’s hormone levels. You might always feel sad shortly before you get your period, or you might feel depressed for some time after giving birth, which is called postpartum depression. You can also develop depressive symptoms later in life, when your testosterone or estrogen levels drop.  In these cases, you’ll experience all the usual symptoms of depression, so you may have a hard time connecting the change in your mood to what’s going on inside your body. Tracking your mood over time can help you recognize patterns and pinpoint a cause, like if you always tend to feel depressed around the same time each month. If you’ve been struggling with symptoms that may be related to changing hormones, tell your primary care doctor or your psychiatrist, who may refer you to an endocrinologist.  Feeling sad can weigh you down and make it tougher to enjoy your life, but it’s an important part of the human experience. Sadness can make you more empathetic toward others and yourself.  But no one deserves to feel sad all or most of the time. If you’re struggling with depressive symptoms, Talkiatry can help.

      "You may not particularly enjoy feeling sad. You may prefer experiencing other emotions. But if you try to avoid the emotion all together, mental health professionals want you to know not to. People tend to think that sadness is always bad, says Meaghan Barlow, PhD, an assistant professor in the department of psychology at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, who studies self-regulation, emotion, and aging. “That's absolutely not my view.” Distinct from depression — which the World Health Organization notes is a leading cause of disability worldwide — sadness is a common emotion. Dr. Barlow says that in the right context, sadness can even be helpful. A growing body of research supports her point of view. Here, Barlow and other experts explain what sadness is, how it impacts well-being, and how you can cope when it feels like too much. Sadness is “an emotional state of unhappiness, ranging in intensity from mild to extreme and usually aroused by the loss of something that is highly valued,” according to the American Psychological Association (APA). Both sadness and anger can feel unpleasant and distressing, and researchers sometimes lump the two together under the umbrella of “negative affect.” (This category also includes shame, guilt, anxiety, fear, and irritability, according to research.) But sadness and anger are distinct emotions with different purposes, as other research has outlined. Anger often occurs in response to a perceived injustice, according to the APA. So when you’re angry, you might have tunnel vision and feel motivated to deal with some kind of problem. “Anger is useful in overcoming resistance,” says Joseph Forgas, a doctor of science in psychology and Scientia Professor of psychology at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. For a long time, researchers didn’t know the purpose of sadness. But now researchers believe that sadness acts as a mild alert, says Dr. Forgas, who studies the emotion. Sadness tells you that you’re in an unfamiliar situation so you need to look out and be careful, he says. The emotion causes a slew of changes in thinking and behavior (more on that later), some of which Forgas detailed in a paper published in Current Directions in Psychological Science. Think about a time you’ve experienced a major rejection, says Ethan Kross, PhD, a professor of psychology and management and organizations at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who studies emotion and self-control. In the aftermath of the unexpected rejection, sadness might cause you to step back and try to better understand what implications that loss has for you. Withdrawing to reflect is a very different response from the quick action of anger, says Dr. Kross. According to the APA, persistent sadness is one of the two defining symptoms of a major depressive episode. But to experience sadness is not the same as having depression. In nondepressed individuals, sadness comes and goes. But when sadness is experienced intensely and for a long time, and is accompanied by other hallmark depression symptoms (lack of interest or pleasure in most activities, fatigue, and changes in appetite), it may indicate the presence of a depressive disorder. “It’s really about the degree and duration,” says Kross. Depression, in contrast to sadness, tends to be debilitating, making it difficult to perform everyday tasks, according to the APA (PDF). “It is a very serious disease that has very serious consequences,” says Forgas. That differs from everyday sad moods, which occur all the time to all of us. It can be tough to tell whether you’re experiencing everyday sadness or depression. Depression doesn’t look the same in everyone, which can make it difficult to recognize sometimes, Kross notes. However, if you experience symptoms including fatigue, changes in your appetite, withdrawing from friends, feeling low energy, and the inability to feel happy over a two-week period to the extent that they’re interfering with day-to-day functioning, consider talking to your doctor about getting screened for a mood disorder. Sadness is ultimately caused by the loss of something important. The sense of loss has an element of emotional time travel, according to Steven C. Hayes, PhD, a clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at the University of Nevada in Reno, who has developed therapeutic strategies that incorporate mindfulness and acceptance. That means that when you experience sadness, Dr. Hayes says, you may be looking backward in time to something you once had or projecting forward and anticipating that your expectations won’t be met. For instance, you may feel sad about recent political upheaval because you hold an expectation for a future world that is more cooperative and kind, and that is threatened by current events. This example highlights an important feature of a sadness-inducing loss: It touches on something you deeply care about. You can recognize sadness in yourself and others through its telltale characteristics. According to a review published in 2020 in Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, the following can be signs of sadness: People who are sad might say they feel lonely, distressed, depressed, anxious, or grief. Researchers who study sadness, including Forgas, acknowledge that the word “sadness” has multiple meanings. These meanings may map on to different experiences. For example, a  study published in 2017 in Frontiers in Psychology compared sadness caused by imagining the death of a loved one and sadness caused by imagining failing to reach a goal. Even though participants in both groups felt sad, the two types of sadness were associated with distinct physical and psychological responses. It can be a useful exercise to find your own description for what sadness is like for you, says Deb Dana, LCSW, a clinician and consultant specializing in complex trauma and author of Anchored: How to Befriend Your Nervous System Using Polyvagal Theory. Dana suggests comparing and contrasting your experience of sadness with how its opposite, happiness, feels. For example, for her, happiness includes moving through the world with lightness, while sadness comes with a heavy feeling in her body. These extremes can help you notice more subtle versions of the feelings. “It’s easier to tap into when they’re so far apart,” she says. The main message coming from a very large number of experiments, including his own lab, says Forgas, is that many positive benefits come from mild, temporary sad moods. Forgas authored a review on the topic, which was published in the journal Australian Psychologist. Sadness, like all emotions, serves an important function by helping us respond to our circumstances in ways that set us up to take better care of our emotional health and well-being. As Kross notes, when we feel sad, we step back, reflect, and return more prepared to deal with what’s in front of us. And sadness may not have as many negative implications for health as other distressing emotions. Research suggests that inflammation and negative affect are linked. Increased inflammation is concerning, says Barlow, because of downstream negative consequences for physical health. But when you look at just sadness, it may not actually affect the body in this way. Research from Barlow’s team, published in 2019 in Psychology and Aging, links self-reported anger with increased inflammation and chronic illness, but not self-reported sadness. Here are some of the specific benefits that have been linked to sadness, and when sadness itself can be unhealthy. In familiar situations, we all rely on mental shortcuts and intuition to get by. When you feel sad, these automatic tendencies are reduced. Forgas says that when you’re sad, it’s almost as if you pay more attention to what’s in front of you. This approach helps you think more clearly in different ways, many of which Forgas has studied over the decades. His lab conducted research showing that people had better eyewitness memory when in a slightly worse mood. Another study demonstrated that on what Forgas calls “sad mood days,” people had improved recall and attention to the environment. More recently, in a paper published in 2019 in Current Directions in Psychological Science, he described a series of studies that together make the case that a sad mood makes people less gullible. All of this happens without your noticing it. By the time you recognize that you’re sad, sadness tends to go away, Forgas says. The takeaway, he says, isn’t that you should try to make yourself sad on purpose to think more clearly; it’s that when you happen to be sad, you can take solace that it may be helping you accurately process what’s going on so you can proceed in healthy ways. You might think you should wait to have a conversation until you’re in a good mood. But Forgas has conducted research that demonstrates that people in a negative mood appear to communicate better than those in a positive one. “They understand ambiguities in sentences better. They're better at persuading other people,” he says. Forgas says that these effects work automatically, not consciously, so the idea isn’t to try to become sad on purpose before a tough conversation. Rather, don’t put off a difficult conversation because it makes you sad; you may be able to better state how you feel in the depths of the emotion. One of the primary functions of sadness is to signal the need for social support, says Barlow. Consider two people: one who is sad and one who is angry. When you see someone who is sad, you have an innate urge to assist them. When you see someone who is angry, you automatically pull away. Researchers have published findings that demonstrate this gut reaction isn’t just you. One study looked at sad facial expressions and another study examined tears, and both found that those signs of sadness appear to signal to others that we could use their help. Sadness appears to improve certain interpersonal skills as well. A study that Forgas was part of showed that people in a negative mood tend to be more fair toward others, while other research showed that they are more polite. One of the key functions of sadness is helping you accept tough situations and come to terms with loss, says Barlow. While facilitating disengagement isn’t always good, it can sometimes be necessary. “Sometimes there are things beyond your control that it's actually adaptive to let go of,” Barlow says. These occasions tend to happen more often as you age, Barlow explains. The onset of chronic illness, for example, often requires that you let go of the goal of trying to reverse or cure something, and instead accept your diagnosis and try to manage whatever it is you’re dealing with, she says. Sadness helps with this by causing changes in thinking and behavior that help people adapt to loss and move forward based on a new circumstances — research (PDF) backs this up). In other words, sadness promotes coping, Forgas says. Other research published in 2021 shows that sadness increases healthy intentions, such as quitting smoking or increasing exercise. People who are sad may feel empowered to make these healthy changes because emotions cause us to see the world in certain ways. Sadness, which is associated with the sense that someone or something is responsible for what has happened, appears to increase people’s belief that circumstances are controllable. Despite all of these potential benefits associated with sadness, when the emotion is experienced too intensely or for too long, it can indeed be bad for your health, says Kross. When sadness persists and is accompanied by other symptoms, it’s considered depression, a clinically diagnosed mood disorder. Research has linked depression to a host of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, according to a review in the European Heart Journal, and death from cancer, per a systematic review in Molecular Psychiatry. Barlow says that whether sadness is bad for your health is all about the context. Ideally, momentary experiences of sadness trigger its adaptive functions, then the sad feelings go away. But, she says, when sadness is consuming in a way that interferes with different aspects of your life, the feeling no longer serves its proper function. A healthy response to sadness begins with allowing yourself to feel sadness when it comes, says Hayes. He says that habits like meditation and prayer can help you notice your sadness without judging it. In time, these mindfulness practices let you stay present with the sometimes painful feeling. But feeling sadness doesn’t mean you need to spend hours alone wallowing or feeling bad, says Hayes. Instead, according to Kross, a healthy response to sadness includes the capacity to dial down how strong the feeling is and shorten how long it lasts. Kross has put together a list of science-backed tools (PDF) that he says can help you do this. One option is to spend time in nature, which can have a calming effect, according to a research review published in Behavioral Sciences. Kross says that using these skills lets you benefit from sadness without experiencing the problems that come when the feeling is too intense or persists for too long. One benefit of sadness comes when we learn from it, says Hayes. It can be helpful to see emotions as gentle guides, not dictators, that provide “one of several sources of information about our present moment,” he says. When you take time to reflect on this information, you can, hopefully, learn something that allows you to move on, adds Kross. But it’s also true that the chronic experience of sadness is a valid reason to seek support, Barlow adds. If your sadness interferes with living the life you want for more than two weeks, or if your coping tools aren’t helping, that’s a cue to get professional help, says Kross. And if you’re ever not sure how severe it is, err on the side of taking your sadness seriously, says Barlow. Instead of going it alone, tell a person you trust about what’s been going on. Someone like your primary care provider can help you decide if you need further care and what to do next.

      "Depression is one of the most common mood disorders in the United States. It causes persistent sadness and limits a person’s ability to go about their daily activities. However, depression is treatable, and people can recover from it. Both lifestyle changes and medical treatments can help individuals feel better. Typically, managing depression is an ongoing process. In this article, we list 16 strategies and treatments that can help fight depression. The more a person knows about depression, the more empowered they will be to find a treatment that works for them. It can be helpful to learn about depression in general, including its causes and symptoms. It is also important for people to get to know their own symptoms and warning signs so that if they are feeling worse, they can identify this. Knowing what prompts depressive episodes can help people avoid or manage triggers, which may reduce future depressive episodes. Educating friends and family members can also help, as loved ones can watch out for warning signs and be supportive when a person is having a difficult time. Reaching out to loved ones can help people get through difficult times. Simply talking about what is happening can help. Also, connecting with others helps reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation. If it does not feel possible to talk to a friend or family member, people may wish to join a support group or see a therapist. Keeping a journal is a powerful strategy for fighting depression. Writing down thoughts, feelings, and problems can allow individuals to identify patterns, triggers, and warning signs relating to their depression. It can also give people perspective on particular issues and help them generate solutions. Writing things down can be especially helpful before bed, especially if distressing thoughts are hindering sleep. If people do not feel comfortable keeping a journal due to privacy concerns, they can destroy the paper afterward. Some people find the act of writing itself cathartic. Another journaling option is to make a list of things for which a person is grateful. Researchers noted positive effects on the brain in people who kept such a list. People sometimes refer to this as keeping a gratitude journal. Seeing a doctor for diagnosis and treatment is an important part of treating depression. A doctor can provide support, guidance, and medical treatment options. Depending on the individual’s symptoms and their wishes, a doctor may prescribe medication or recommend psychotherapy. Anyone experiencing severe depression should see a doctor as soon as possible, while thoughts of suicide should prompt a person to call 911 or contact the National Suicide Prevention Line on 800-273-8266. If you know someone at immediate risk of self-harm, suicide, or hurting another person: If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, a prevention hotline can help. The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is available 24 hours a day at 988. During a crisis, people who are hard of hearing can use their preferred relay service or dial 711 then 988. Find more links and local resources. Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, can be highly effective for depression. Depending on the type of therapy, it may help people: Doctors commonly recommend cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression. Research suggests that CBT can help treat depression, and it may be an effective alternative to medication in some cases. Other types of therapy, including interpersonal therapy and psychodynamic therapy, can also help people with depression. Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment. It stops people from concentrating on the past or worrying about the future. Anyone can practice mindfulness at any time, but some people may find it helpful to begin by using an app or attending a class. Recent research from 2019 links mindfulness practices with lower levels of depression and anxiety. Pairing mindfulness with CBT in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy may prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes as effectively as maintenance antidepressant medications. People who treat the mind and body as separate entities may have a more careless attitude about health and well-being than those who connect the two. Many alternative practitioners believe that connecting the mind and body is essential for overall physical and mental health. The following practices connect the mind and body, which could help people feel better and practice more healthful behaviors: Physical activity can release endorphins that improve mood, and research indicates that exercise is effective in treating the symptoms of major depression. Even though exercise may be the last thing that many people feel like doing when they are going through a depressive episode, it can often be helpful. A person can start slowly, such as by going for a short walk or swim once or twice a week. A 2018 study looked at whether exercise could help reduce depression symptoms when people were already receiving therapy and antidepressant medication. The results showed that 75% of the participants who also exercised experienced fewer or a complete remission of symptoms compared with 25% of the participants who did not exercise. The results also suggested that exercise improved biomarkers of depression and reduced associated sleep problems. Food has a significant effect on mood and mental health. Deficiencies in some nutrients, including omega-3s and iron, have links to depression. Eating a balanced, nutritious diet can help prevent deficiencies and keep a person feeling physically well, which can support mental health. Most of a person’s calories should come from: Alcohol and recreational drugs make the symptoms of depression much worse. They can also make the condition harder to treat. People who struggle to avoid these substances may wish to consider speaking to a doctor or therapist. Some supplements may be beneficial when people with depression take them as part of a treatment plan. However, it is vital to speak to a doctor before taking supplements. Some may interact with antidepressants or other medications, or they may be unsuitable for people who are pregnant or have existing medical conditions. Examples of supplements that people sometimes take for depression include: Learn more about supplements and herbs for depression in this article. Feeling stressed and overwhelmed contributes to feelings of depression. Taking time out to relax can mitigate some of the effects of stress and help restore a person’s energy. Every day, try scheduling at least a few minutes of relaxation time. Relaxing means different things for different people. Some options include: Setting goals and targets can sometimes help when a person is feeling demotivated. However, it is important to make sure that goals are achievable, specific, and realistic. People may also wish to set a time frame around achieving each goal. For example, instead of saying, “I will start to exercise more,” a person can make specific, actionable goals, such as, “I will go for a 15-minute walk tomorrow morning before work.” Breaking down larger goals into smaller steps using these same principles can also help when a person is going through depression. For example, instead of planning to clean the kitchen, decide to empty the trash, and fill the dishwasher. Once those tasks are complete, a person can choose to set more if they feel up to it. Volunteering for a worthy cause can come with a myriad of mental health benefits. Research indicates that people who volunteer may enjoy better mental and physical health, fewer depressive symptoms, and less psychological distress. They may also have higher life satisfaction, self-esteem, and happiness. To find a volunteering opportunity, people can approach local organizations or look online on websites such as Volunteer Match. Regular, quality sleep is essential for mental health. Too much or too little sleep can be a symptom of depression when it occurs along with other symptoms, such as prolonged feelings of sadness. Aim to sleep for 7–9 hours each night and to go to bed and get up at the same time each day. Try to unwind before bed with a set routine, such as having a warm bath, drinking chamomile tea, or reading. The results of a 2013 study suggest that getting out in nature can provide an important boost to mental health. Part of this effect may be due to the fact that time outdoors increases a person’s exposure to sunlight, which increases serotonin and vitamin D levels. The study found that people who walked in nature had elevated moods compared with those who walked in a city environment. In an urban environment, people deal with increased noise, advertising, and traffic, which can all be stressors. Being in nature may, therefore, be more restorative. Consider spending more time outdoors in the following ways: Depression is a treatable mood disorder. People can recover from depressive episodes with lifestyle changes, coping strategies, talk therapy, or medications. For most people, a combination of these methods is necessary. It is vital to see a doctor if symptoms of depression persist for 2 weeks or more. A doctor can provide a diagnosis and recommend a treatment plan. To maintain recovery from depression, it is essential to treat mental health in the same way as physical health — by working on it on an ongoing basis.

      "Eggshell Therapy and Coaching Eggshell Therapy and Coaching Table of Contents Feeling empty and emotionally numb can be a result of emotional detachment or a syndrome known as depersonalization. Feeling empty and numb is, in essence, the experience of feeling disconnected, surreal, and unable to identify emotions. When you are emotionally numb, you are also feeling empty and detached, as if you are an outside observer of your own life. You see your life without living in it. You may also feel that you are losing control over your thoughts or actions. Have you ever ask yourself these questions? Why do I feel empty, like I don’t even exist? Why do I feel nothing when I should? Why do I feel emotionally numb when I should be happy or upset? Why do I feel detached from my loved ones, family, and friends? Why do I look into the mirror and feel like I am seeing someone else? Why do I feel like a robot, running on an auto-pilot? Why do I feel hollow, with little joy, ups or downs in my life? Why do I have this surreal feeling as I go through my day-to-day? If you identify with the above, you might be struggling with or a form of dissociation known as depersonalization. Feeling empty, emotionally numb, or hollow, is prevalent in our emotion-phobic modern society- yet it is also one of the most underestimated and unaccounted for conditions.  “Louise often feels like part of her is “acting.” At the same time , “there is another part ‘inside’ that is not connecting with the me that is talking to you,” she says. When the depersonalization is at its most intense, she feels like she just doesn’t exist. These experiences leave her confused about who she really is, and quite often, she feels like an “actress” or simply, “a fake.”\n",
      "― Daphne Simeon On the surface, it might seem strange that emotionally intense and highly sensitive people who tend to feel so much would also struggle with being emotionally numb or feeling nothing. However, your sensitivity and intensity could be precisely why you had turned to numbness as an armor to protect yourself. It might be that from a young age you were overwhelmed by too many strong emotions such that you adopted numbing as a way to cope. It might be that your childhood environment was violent and precarious, so you had no choice but to detach from what was happening, cut yourself off, and resort to feeling empty, and emotional numbness to cope. Out in the wild, self-defense is essential for survival. When faced with life-threatening danger, animals will either retreat, attack, assume threatening poses, spout poison, or camouflage themselves. What do we humans do when confronted with physical danger or emotional trauma? We might verbally or physically retaliate, we might run away. If neither is an option, we detach from ourselves, hide our true feelings by disappearing into a zone where our minds can live in denial of reality, and as a result, we find ourselves feeling nothing but void. Once we have experienced a physically or emotionally painful situation, such as childhood abuse, neglect, or other forms of trauma, we will do all we can to defend ourselves against ever being hurt again. We do so by building up a wall against the outside world. This is what emotional numbness helps us do. Like a protective mechanism in an electric circuit, emotional numbness and emptiness kick in when we are unable to bear the weight of the truth. Therefore, when you ask yourself ‘Why do I feel empty’, try not to do it in a punitive, self-critical way. Rather, be glad that the defence mechanism in you is working to protect you against trauma. Without your inner protector, things could have been worse. Unfortunately, for some of us, the oppressive sense of abandonment, rejection, terror, or shame persists beyond the traumatic event, and ‘feeling emotionally numb’ or ‘feeling nothing’ becomes an auto-pilot response. Like Pavlov’s dogs, we become hard-wired to respond to life in a certain way. Research has shown that childhood trauma emanating from separation (e.g., death of a parent), physical neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse, witnessing violence, and sexual abuse has a strong bearing on one’s tendency to develop depersonalization. Of the above factors listed, emotional maltreatment by one’s parent or parents was found to be the most significant trigger for emotional numbness.  Since emotional maltreatment by a parent does not leave any visible signs, its impact on the child often goes undetected until much later in life, when he/she exhibits an inability to self-regulate emotions. Even in the absence of abuse, an emotionally sensitive child can feel out-of-place in their own home; especially if the parents fail to recognize that their child may feel and think differently from them. Telling a hypersensitive child to be stoic and rational, or excessively criticizing them when they have emotional outbursts, can push the child to feel incredibly alienated. The effect of being an apple that falls far from the tree is compounded by our culture, which promotes the values of masculinity, stoicism, regimentation, and rationalism. As paradoxical as it may sound, emotionally intense people are the most vulnerable to shielding themselves by being emotionally numb in order to appear ‘normal’ in the world. Initially, disconnecting, feeling empty and being emotionally numb give you a pseudo-calm. It allows you to go on with life, to attend to your work responsibilities, chores, and free others from worrying about you. It may even conveniently allow you to appear’ ‘high-functioning’ in the outside world. But this facade comes at a high price. Feeling emotionally numb inhibits your ability to laugh wholeheartedly, express real sadness, or show excitement. By being emotionally numb, you may have become a bystander to your own life. Eventually, as you grow accustomed to living inside the walls you build around yourself, you forget who you truly are– Passionate, emotional, excitable, the opposite of feeling empty. You may become detached not only from the outside world, but also from your innermost passion, playfulness, and vitality. People experience emptiness and emotional numbness differently. You may feel chronically bored, or you may struggle to find words for your feelings. You may detach from your body, gradually losing the ability to be attuned to signals of hunger, tiredness, or losing your sex drive. You may lose the ability to respond to events with joy or sadness or struggle to connect with others in a deep and meaningful way. In Schema Therapy, the wall you build between your true self and your feelings is called “a detach protector”. Much like what its name indicates, this wall started out as a benign attempt to protect yourself. It was valuable at some point in your life, but might have expired as a survival strategy and is now doing nothing but holding you back. It is essential to understand that feeling empty and feeling numb is not a conscious choice and we must be compassionate with ourselves. Rather than resenting what has happened, we ought to be grateful to our  ‘detached protector’ for saving our lives from unbearable pain.   “Oh God just look at me now… one night opens words and utters pain… I cannot begin to explain to you… this… I am not here. This is not happening. Oh wait, it is, isn’t it? I am a ghost. I am not here, not really. You see skin and cuts and frailty…these are symptoms, you known, of a ghost.”  ― Emily Andrews, The Finer Points of Becoming Machine\n",
      " 1. You are unable to experience or express emotions – positive or negative, including love and joy. 2. You routinely engage in mind-numbing activities such as TV watching or procrastination. You gain no pleasure from these activities, yet you do not feel motivated to do anything else. 3. You feel disconnected from your body. You feel fatigued, lifeless, and do not receive signals regarding hunger, thirst, tiredness or other discomforts. 4. You do not react in situations that would typically evoke emotions, such as watching movies or receiving certain news. 5. You feel like a passive observer of your life. Rather than living each moment with vitality, life seems unreal. 6. You go about each day in auto-pilot mode. By adopting emotional numbness or depersonalization, you are not truly living. You are watching your life from a seat in the audience. 7. You no longer find joy in doing activities you once enjoyed. Your memories feel like someone else’s story. 8. You become less and less interested in socializing or connecting with people and feel detached from friends and family. 9. You feel no one knows the real you. And gradually, you know yourself less and less. You lose touch with your own interests, passions and dreams. 10. You feel a lingering sense of boredom. \n",
      " “”Oh God just look at me now… one night opens words and utters pain… I cannot begin to explain to you… this… I am not here. This is not happening. Oh wait, it is isn’t’ it? I am a ghost. I am not here, not really. You see skin and cuts and frailty…these are symptoms, you known, of a ghost”.” ― Emily Andrews, The Finer Points of Becoming Machine   Emotions are what make us human. ‘Why do I feel empty?’ “Why do I feel emotionally numb’? You might have asked these questions in great pain, but these questions point not to a defect, but deep strengths and creative self-protective mechanisms in you. Feeling numb or using emotional avoidance as a coping mechanism works for a while, but ultimately, your trauma and feelings are going to find a way to creep back. When the floodgates burst open, you may be shocked, feel out of control, and frightened by your own behaviours. You may then employ drastic measures to push the feelings back down, engaging in alcohol and drug abuse, overspending, bingeing, self-mutilation, and other impulsive behaviors. If left untreated, emotional numbness can manifest itself in the form of chronic physical ailments. It is a vicious cycle that becomes exasperating and physically draining, leaving you with even lesser energy to engage with family and friends. In the extreme, just like many who have PTSD or Complex PTSD, you may develop suicidal ideations. When we turn away from what we consider to be negative emotions, we also say goodbye to joy, love, and all that life has to offer. In the end, we are lonely and stranded in a cold, barren place. There will always be a voice inside that reminds us we are wasting away our lives without fully living. Inside of you is a wild, innocent and playful child. Deep down, you long to live life with your full heart, to feel safe and to be held by others around you, and to love them, too, without holding back. Feeling empty or emotionally numb as a survival strategy does not have to be forever. Through the construction of emotional skills and resilience, you can begin to dip your feet into the deep waters of feeling. You can start with small steps such as learning the language of emotions or building the ability to regulate. Slowly but surely, you will re-open the door to experience life’s joy, abundance, and aliveness—things that a hidden part of you has long been yearning for.  “Dissociation, a form of hypnotic trance, helps children survive the abuse…The abuse takes on a dream-like, surreal quality and deadened feelings and altered perceptions add to the strangeness. The whole scene does not fit into the ‘real world.’ It is simple to forget, easy to believe nothing happened.”\n",
      "― Renee Fredrickson Chronically being emotionally numb is a complex psychological condition. With courage and commitment, you can peel back layer-upon-layer of armour and reclaim the true self that has long waited for your attention. Here are some of the healing steps in this process. 1. Let Go of Any Guilt or Shame that Comes from Being Emotionally Numb As stated earlier, feeling numb is a psychological response and not something that you have consciously chosen. Unfortunately, your inability to express feelings for others might have hurt and disappointed those that are the closest to you. Perhaps you have lost a few loving relationships along the way. The past cannot be undone, it does not have to mean you carry shame or guilt for the rest of your life.  Remember, your emptiness and numbness grew out of pain and was nothing but a desperate attempt to survive.  Approach your emptiness and emotional numbness with compassion, and even gratitude. Rather than condemn yourself, love yourself back into life.  2. Embrace Tenderness As you first strip away the armour that protected you for years, you may be overcome with a tsunami of emotions as your true feelings are revealed. You may feel tender or emotional, and surprise yourself with bursts of laughter and tears. Fear not, as you are simply returning to your natural state. Your body will slowly learn that it is safe to feel feelings. Very soon, you will even enjoy the sense of aliveness and connection it gives you. Even if the ride is turbulent, it is nevertheless a glorious one. 3. Visualize the barrier and dissolve it  In a quiet place, try and visualise your emotional numbness as a wall you have created, then ask yourself the following questions:     •    How thick is the wall?     •    What is the wall made of? Is it cold metal? Plastic? Or maybe cotton wool?     •    Does the wall feel cold or warm? Does it move around?     •    Has it remained static or grown in thickness over time?     •    Do you see that the wall now has cracks in it?   •    If your wall has a personality and a voice, what is it saying to you?     •    Are you ready to let it go? 4. Thanking and transforming the emptiness or emotional numbness Thank the emptiness or numbness for the purpose it has served in your life. But now it is time to break through and move towards the other side. Say to your shield, ”Thank you for protecting me all these years. Without you, I couldn’t have lived through those hard times. However, I am stronger now, and I no longer need you. I promise you, I will take care of myself. It is safe for us to say goodbye.” You may add affirmations that help you move forward in life: ‘I am ready to experience life.’ ’It is okay for me to feel sad sometimes.’ ‘Feeling tender is not a sign of weakness.’ Things may not change overnight, but the next time you feel the shield emerging, you will be more aware. It will no longer be an unconscious, destructive force outside of your control. Your emotional wall is there to protect you in times of danger. You may choose to use it, or not. But the power remains in you. 5. Connect to your physical self For people who are chronically feeling empty or emotionally numb, life can be an out-of-body experience. Reconnecting with your physical body is an essential step in feeling alive. Different things work for different people. Practising deep-breathing techniques, self-massage, yoga, meditation, and tai-chi are some of the ways to connect with your mind, body, and soul. 6. Do something cathartic Anger is a challenging emotion for many people. It may well be the very emotions that you have defended against with your shield. Allow yourself to get in touch with your vitality through the following cathartic exercise, even if it feels unnatural at first.     •    Scream into a pillow to let it all out. Even if your anger is directed towards yourself.     •    Write a journal to document moments of your life that created feelings of immense sadness or loneliness. Try to answer the questions ‘Why do I feel empty?’ and ‘Why do I feel numb?’ ‘What am I trying to protect against?’ ‘What would I have to otherwise feel if I don’t feel empty, feel numb?’     •    Paint or write a poem to express yourself creatively.     •    Enrol for an intense dance or exercise class.     •    Join a group for people with emotional numbness disorder. Finally, dear sensitive souls, I would like to remind you that you are worth a full life. No matter how you have pretended and defended over the past many years, deep inside your longing to love and to receive love once again, never died. When you begin to acknowledge the deep-rooted sense of fear, shame, abandonment, or rejection, a natural thawing process will follow. Once the weight of heavy emotions is lifted, for the first time in a long time, you will see the reservoir of passion and vitality that have always been there, waiting to be discovered by you.

      "Emotional numbness or emotional blunting refers to having limited emotional responses to internal and external events. It may be a symptom of a medical condition or a side effect of some medications.  Emotional numbness can create a sense of emptiness, isolation, or disconnect from the rest of the world. You may notice other people react to events in a different way, and it may be difficult for you to understand why you don’t feel the same way. Not everyone experiences emotional numbness in the same way. In general, you may feel limited when it comes to emotional experiences. You may have a muted response to events you used to react to, or you may experience the emotion and yet have no outward expression of it. You may be in a situation that typically calls for sadness or joy, and you may not feel either. This may make relating to others more challenging. Other signs of emotional numbness may include: Emotional numbness, sometimes called emotional blunting, can be difficult to imagine if you have not experienced it. Some people describe it as feeling empty or discouraged, while others report feeling isolated.  “Often, I feel invisible, like I’m a ghost. I watch my family engaging with each other, but feel like there’s an invisible barrier that keeps me from joining them,” describes Amy H., who has experienced emotional numbness as a symptom of depression. “I’m like a submarine drifting undetected, picking up on other people’s emotions like sonar. However, if you were to ask me what my own feelings are, I wouldn’t be able to tell you.” Rebecca C.* has a similar experience with numbness caused by depression: “The world around me often seems slightly superficial, [like] I am simply going through the motions and can’t connect to my environment,” she explains. “It makes me feel as if there were analog TV static in my brain. I am unable to communicate or think deeply.”  Some people describe emotional numbness as feeling unfocused or ungrounded. “It basically feels like when you zone out before you go to sleep,” Amanda D. said. “Feels like being unfocused. And sometimes, especially right when you are going through it, it’s really hard to understand how the world keeps moving when it should have stopped.” *Some names have been changed at the request of interviewees. A number of factors may lead to emotional numbness. While living with depression and anxiety is the most common cause of emotional blunting, others may include: Emotional numbness is often temporary. It may last a few hours to days at a time. Treatment is available to provide both immediate and long-term relief.  The first step in treating emotional numbness is to identify and treat the underlying cause. A healthcare professional can help with this, or they may refer you to a mental health professional. They may ask about all the medications you currently take and those you’ve taken in the last year. They may also want to explore what other symptoms you experience. If your healthcare professional thinks one of your medications is involved, they may switch you to a different brand or type, or adjust your dosage. If you do not already have a mental health professional, the FindCare tool can help you locate one in your area. A mental health professional can offer coping techniques to help you work on your emotional experience. Some professionals, like psychiatrists, may prescribe medications, but talk therapy can also help.  While antidepressants typically take up to 6 weeks to start working, your professional may prescribe anti-anxiety medication like benzodiazepines or beta-blockers for a short time while the other drug builds in your system. Even if you’re having trouble connecting, consider reaching out to the people who love you. They may understand what you’re going through and help you connect. You may find relief in telling them what you’re going through.  Running, swimming, yoga, and kickboxing classes may help you with stress relief. Even taking a walk may help flood your brain with endorphins, feel good chemicals. Regular activity may be more effective. Getting 7–9 hours of quality sleep every night could help increase your focus and motivation, and may improve how you feel.  For long-term treatment and prevention of emotional numbness, consider these: Depending on its cause, emotional numbness may be a temporary experience. Usually, addressing the underlying cause may help you find relief. For example, if blunting is related to depression, receiving treatment for this condition can help you decrease emotional numbness and other symptoms.  Working with a mental health professional can help. They can support you in bridging the gap and bringing you one step closer to feeling your feelings. Emotional blunting is usually temporary and may improve once you address the underlying cause. You may feel emotionally numb for a few hours or days at a time, or in some cases, for longer than that. If you live with untreated depression or PTSD, you may feel emotionally numb for as long as the condition goes without professional support. Treatment is available and effective. Addressing the underlying cause of emotional numbness is the first step toward getting relief. Regular physical activity, a balanced diet, support from your loved ones, and working with a mental health professional can help. Feeling emotionally numb may have different causes. If you feel detached and indifferent about your relationships, it could be a sign of a mental health condition, like depression or anxiety, or the result of past trauma or medications. A mental health professional can help you explore possible causes. Once you address those, you may find relief. Emotional pain may be hard to cope with, but often going through the experience helps you heal. If you live with conditions like depression, PTSD, or anxiety, a mental health professional can help you develop coping skills to manage emotional pain. For severe symptoms, medications may help. If you’re mourning a loss, a therapist may also help you work through your grief.  Emotional numbness may result from painful life experiences, including traumatic stress. A mental health professional can help you work through and recover from trauma.  If you feel like you’re having a mental health emergency, you can: If you decide to call an emergency number like 911, ask the operator to send someone trained in mental health, like Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) officers. Emotional numbness or blunting refers to difficulty experiencing and expressing the full range of emotions. You may feel detached, indifferent, or empty.  Causes of emotional numbness range from side effects of medications to symptoms of mental health disorders. In most cases, you may experience relief once the underlying cause has been addressed.  Talk therapy, self-care, and in some cases, medications may help.

      "That feeling of emptiness. It’s right there in your chest, yet you’re unsure how it came about. Is it sadness? Melancholy? Boredom? It may be a little of everything. Feeling this way is not uncommon. You might call it “feeling empty,” while someone else might call it something different.  What matters the most is that it’s real, valid. Although overwhelming, it can be managed. Uncovering what’s lying underneath this emptiness feeling might not be a straightforward process, but it’s possible and a recommended first step toward resolution. The feeling of emptiness might last a few days and then resolve on its own.  Other times, it might linger for two weeks or longer. When this is the case, learning to recognize cognitive distortions and seeking the support of a mental health professional can help.  Feeling empty can sometimes manifest as a sense of loneliness, confusion about your life and goals, or lack of motivation to pursue anything in life.  Everyone might feel this void in their heart from time to time.  The experience could have many causes, including shifting hormonal levels, losing a job, or the required physical distancing that comes with a pandemic. Any life stage or situation that may require you to reflect on yourself and your life might also lead to a temporary feeling of emptiness. Although not in every case, feeling empty could also signify some mental health conditions, such as depression, bipolar disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Only a mental health professional can diagnose your condition accurately. It’s not unusual for someone to lose touch with themselves once in a while. A lack of insight into yourself may lead to that lingering emptiness feeling. Some people call this “living without a purpose.” It means that you might not have clarity on the type of person you are or the one you want to become.  Not having specific goals or dreams to achieve can also lead you to feel empty. Losing touch with yourself can come from many circumstances. For example, a consuming relationship or a demanding job.  Sometimes, feeling melancholy might have to do with a long grieving process that you haven’t explored yet.  For example, an unresolved painful experience in your childhood or a sense of abandonment from a family member. When we don’t openly talk or explore emotions that have been with us for a long time, they might manifest in other ways.  Even if it feels overwhelming and painful, thinking and talking about significant past events that caused you grief may help you process them. Depending on how strong you feel about these events, going through the process with a mental health professional is highly advisable.  For some people, taking care of others might come first. This could lead them to put their own needs aside for a long time. This, in turn, may lead to feeling empty. You might feel that making others happy makes you happy, too. Even if this is the case, it’s important to consider that supporting others is not exclusive of supporting yourself. Everyone needs support and care, including you. Often, when your needs are fulfilled, you become better equipped to help and support others, too. Abandoning yourself, not listening to your own hopes and desires, could make you feel empty, explained Kaitlyn Slight, a marriage and family therapist in Durham, North Carolina. Not taking care of your needs can lead to anxiety, guilt, and shame, Slight said. These symptoms might be what you call “feeling empty.” How much time you spend on social media might also affect how you feel and could fuel the feelings of emptiness.  In many instances, accounts you follow on social media might portray a lifestyle that’s not realistic or a perfect life or appearance. This could lead you to compare yourself and inevitably underscore your life.  The Harvard Study of Adult Development, one of the longest studies about adult life, has found that maintaining close and good relationships is the most important aspect of the human experience.  This means that it’s not about how many relationships you have but rather the quality of these relationships. Emotional intimacy, support, active listening, and company are all important. When these are missing in your life, it could lead to feelings of emptiness and loneliness. Depression is a mental health condition that involves many symptoms including: A feeling of emptiness or numbness could be another sign of depression, according to Ashley Eder, LPC, a psychotherapist in Boulder, Colorado.  In fact, some of Eder’s clients who live with depression report feeling empty instead of sad, she said.  “This kind of empty feeling comes with not caring about much, not being interested in things, not feeling fueled by anything in particular,” Eder explained. Feeling empty is not always a sign of depression, though. The only person who can diagnose your condition accurately is a mental health professional.  It’s natural to feel concerned if you’ve noticed a change in yourself. Recognizing this feeling and addressing it is the first step toward feeling better. If you’re feeling empty, seeing a mental health professional can help.  A therapist could help you work through your feelings, uncover the cause of the numbness, and address it in a way that works best for you. Finding ways to stop feeling empty may depend on what’s causing it.  For example, if you feel numb after trauma, you might need to process this particular event. If you’ve felt empty for a long time, psychotherapy can help you unveil some of the reasons that led you here. You can read about the different types of hopelessness here If you’re experiencing emptiness that’s more like a gaping hole, acknowledge it, and be gentle with yourself, said Eder.  Remember that you’re doing the best you can at any given moment. Feeling guilty is not uncommon, but it might stop you from seeking help.  Begin by recognizing your own feelings and needs. Even if challenging, try to avoid dismissing yourself and what you feel.  If you acknowledge that your feelings are linked to a loss you experienced, consider allowing yourself time and space to grieve openly. Grief looks and feels different to everyone, and there are no right or wrong ways to do it. Once you’ve acknowledged your losses, you might go through five stages of grief.  Maybe the loss involves someone leaving your life physically or emotionally. Eder suggested speaking to yourself with compassion when exploring these feelings and past experiences. For instance, you might say: “It’s been hard to feel so lonely,” or “You’re right; you did need more love.” It’s natural to sometimes turn to certain events or activities to not think about how you feel. For example, you might feel inclined to go out with friends or spend the night playing video games. Slight suggests you fight the urge and instead save time to be with yourself and look within. This may include exploring your own desires, fears, hopes, and dreams, she said. Because different activities work for different people, you might find that meditation, writing, or exercise helps you refocus yourself. “It may feel uncomfortable at first, but the more you practice devoting time and energy to yourself and caring for yourself, the less present those empty feelings will be,” Slight said. Eder suggested setting a timer for 5 minutes and noticing what you’re feeling right now.  “It doesn’t have to be earth-shattering,” she explained.  You might want to write “bored” or “distracted” or “curious.” If you’re having a hard time naming your feelings, Google “feelings list,” she suggested. It also can help to pick one part of your body, such as your hand or head. Eder recommended to then “scan for various categories of sensation like temperature, tension or movement.” Practicing these exercises every day can help you open yourself to deeper and longer self-explorations. You can read more about somatic exercises for anxiety here Journaling might also help work on your feelings of emptiness, said Slight. She suggested exploring the following questions as a starting point:  After sitting with your feelings and exploring them, you might find it helpful to connect with others.  Reaching out to friends or family can help you feel better, especially if you’re able to confide in them about your feelings. One idea is to regularly connect with loved ones through social engagements, hobbies, and mutual interests. Depression and grief might sometimes cause you to neglect daily self-care. This is not something to feel ashamed of, but engaging in acts of self-care might help you feel better.  This could include basic things, such as eating nutritious meals, getting enough sleep, and exercising. Hunger and tiredness can sometimes exacerbate negative feelings. Consider finding positive outlets for your emotions, like journaling, a new hobby, or creative pursuit.  Mindfulness and yoga are also often recommended for depression and anxiety.  Consider a 10-minute yoga workout on YouTube or a quick meditation exercise using a mindfulness app.  You might also want to limit the time you spend on social media. This could progressively help you feel better.  If you can’t or don’t, then try reminding yourself that what you see on the screen might not be an attainable goal for anyone. You could see it as watching a science-fiction movie that’s fun to watch but not based on reality. You’re doing the best you can with the resources at hand.  Even as children, some people find ways to protect themselves from hurt. One of these ways might be repressing feelings. “In that case, give yourself credit for coming up with a solution that worked when you were small and powerless,” said Eder. Commend yourself for all the ways you’ve come up with to cope with events in your life.  Now, said Eder, consider allowing those feelings to come out. “You have some catching up to do. And you don’t need to rush to override your old way of survival,” she added. Sometimes, feeling empty might lead to more distressing thoughts. If this is your case, Slight said, considering therapy can help. It can help “empower you to make your own decisions about how to implement positive changes.” If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, unable to function in your daily life, or considering hurting yourself or others, a mental health professional can help. If you or someone you know is considering self-harm, you’re not alone. Help is available right now:  Although it’s natural to feel empty or numb from time to time, these feelings can sometimes linger for two weeks or more. Acknowledging how you feel and setting a few self-care strategies in place can help.

It’s hard to describe what feeling numb is like, but you’ll intuitively know it if you’ve felt it. Know that you’re not alone. Many people report feeling disconnected from the world around them sometimes, feeling “flat,” or feeling like life is on autopilot. Perhaps events and people seem muted, or less colorful somehow.  It can also be described as chronically running on empty, feeling ungrounded, having a hard time focusing, or losing track of time throughout the day. Feeling numb can make it hard to connect with others, which creates loneliness or a sense of isolation in your experience. Emotional numbness, also called “affective blunting,” is most commonly associated with depression. It can also occur with other mental health conditions and medications. It can be linked with states like dissociation or depersonalization — feelings of being disconnected from yourself, your emotions, or your surroundings. The good news is, emotional numbness is usually temporary and treatable. This article will walk you through causes, treatment, self-help strategies, and additional resources. There’s no one answer to this question, but experts have a pretty good theory. Emotional numbness can occur when the limbic system is flooded with stress hormones. This is the area of the brain that deals with emotional regulation and memory. There’s an emotional component as well. High-stress situations can tax our emotions and exhaust the physical body. The combination of the two can lead to a feeling of being drained and, consequently, numb.  Numbness may also be a coping mechanism to prevent more pain from entering the psyche. This is especially true for those in high-stress environments and those who have experienced trauma. The mental health conditions most often associated with emotional numbness are depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Emotional numbness can also come up in some dissociative disorders, which are connected with a personal history of trauma. Depersonalization is the sense of being disconnected from yourself, as if you’re having an out-of-body experience.  Anyone can experience this disconnect. Sometimes, it’s linked with an anxiety disorder or depersonalization-derealization disorder. It’s also one of the less talked about symptoms of a panic attack. In some cases, antidepressants may be the cause of emotional numbness. A 2017 study showed that 46% of research participants experienced emotional numbness as a side effect of medication, most commonly with a classification of antidepressants called selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). In the moment, you probably don’t feel like doing much at all. Sometimes, just curling up in a blanket and making yourself comfortable can feel soothing. Other times, it can help to move around, talk with a friend, or release some pent-up emotion. We talk more about these methods below. Emotional numbness may feel like being “frozen” for some people. If this is the case for you, exercise might be the last thing on your mind.  However, doing any form of physical movement is a great way to get out of your head and into your body. Try just walking around your room and shaking your arms out to connect with your body, or put on a lively song and move to the music in a way that feels good.  If you want to crank it up a gear, try working up a sweat with a bike ride, a brisk walk outdoors, swimming, or some yoga.  If none of these options sound appealing, remember what physical activities you used to love as a child — the hobbies that brought you pure, unbridled joy. Maybe that’s roller-skating, horseback riding, or boogie boarding. Do more of these activities to see if you can tap into that youthful exuberance. For optimal health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends getting at least 30 minutes of moderate physical exercise at least 5 days a week. Moderate exercise means you’re breaking a sweat and your heart is working hard. Regular exercise will get the endorphins flowing and perhaps help you feel more alive, yet grounded in your body. Sometimes, when we feel like we have no one to talk to, we shove our uncomfortable emotions down because we feel safer that way. Do this for long enough, though, and you might find it easier to feel nothing at all — as in, emotional numbness. While it’s hard to be vulnerable, it’s also hard to keep everything bottled up inside. It can help to open up to someone you trust about what you’re going through. You might say something like, “I notice that lately I don’t feel much of anything at all. Has this ever happened to you?”  The bonding experience will release a neurotransmitter called oxytocin, also known as the cuddle hormone. This feeling of connection may be a welcome relief from the sense of “nothingness” you may be used to.  If you don’t feel like opening up to a friend or family member, you might consider reaching out through an online forum, a support group, or a session with a therapist to talk about what you’re experiencing. If you feel numb and disconnected, it might help to gently bring your awareness to your body and your surroundings using grounding techniques. These techniques are often recommended for coping with PTSD and anxiety.  Grounding can be physical or mental. Here are some ideas to try: You can find lots more ideas for grounding exercises in this guide. If you suspect that the emotional numbness has to do with repressed frustration, consider going to a beach or a lake and throwing stones into the water. Or you might consider taking kickboxing classes or booking a day at a batting cage.  You can also look up a local Rage Room. Once there, you’ll be given safety gear and weapons to smash things, like plates and old TVs, in a safe environment.  Self-study can be an effective tool to become familiar with what you’re feeling. Create a mood diary, set a daily alarm, and jot down your emotions every day at the same time. Assign what you’re feeling a number between 1 and 10. If digital note-taking is more your style, try these mood tracker apps. There’s way more to the world of emotions than just happy, sad, and angry. If you’re trying to figure out what you’re feeling, refer to this list of emotions — 54 of them, to be exact. Chances are that you’ve felt numb at times in the past, too. When this feeling comes up again and again, it’s worth considering making a longer-term action plan. A doctor or psychiatrist may recommend psychotherapy, or talk therapy, to work through the challenges in your life. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), for example, can help you bridge any gaps between your thoughts, emotions, and behavioral patterns. Somatic experiencing therapy can also help. Somatic means “of the body.” This therapy focuses on the mind-body connection to address physical and psychological symptoms of trauma, grief, and other mental health issues. Another method that some therapists use is called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Using a series of light taps or tones, you review past trauma through an observer perspective and anchor new thoughts and beliefs about what happened. The American Psychological Association provides a search tool to help you locate a psychologist near you.  Depression and anxiety are associated with low serotonin, the “happy hormone.” Low serotonin levels can contribute to a sense of numbness. If you’re not currently on medication, then a psychiatrist may prescribe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to help you feel better. Some medications you may have heard of include Prozac and Zoloft. If you’re already on a medication and experiencing emotional numbness, a psychiatrist will provide you with options of what to take instead.  When switching antidepressants, be patient with the process. It may take up to 6 weeks for the new drug to create an impact on your system. In the meantime, your psychiatrist may provide antianxiety medication to help your symptoms subside more quickly. The American Psychiatric Association provides a search tool to help you locate a psychiatrist near you. If you feel nothing at all, it can help to get some answers about why it’s happening in the first place. This is best reserved for a doctor or trusted mental health professional.  They will ask about your medication regimen and personal history in order to rule out the possibility of an underlying health condition, like a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Research shows this can be a cause of emotional numbness.  A consistent meditation practice can help you get in touch with your feelings by introducing you to your inner world. You’ll get to see the full extent of what goes on in your mind. Awareness can be a powerful tool for broadening the gap between your trigger (emotional pain) and response (emotional numbness). Smart small. Find a comfortable seated position with your back up against a wall. Relax your gaze or close your eyes. Maybe turn on a diffuser with some lavender essential oil. If it feels good, add some light classical music, a genre known for evoking powerful emotions.  Set the Insight Timer app for just 2 minutes and see what comes up in your mind. Congratulations, you just meditated. There’s no wrong way to do it. To build on a meditation practice, consider attending a yoga class. As a yoga student and, later, as an instructor, I can’t tell you the number of times I witnessed myself and students spontaneously shed tears during practice.  In yogic tradition, it’s said that emotions are stored physically in the body. It makes sense that if you twist, turn, and bend enough, eventually something will loosen up and release. Think of it as a way to unclog the cork. If this happens to you in yoga class, try not to be embarrassed. It’s totally normal. You can always go down onto your mat and rest in a child’s pose while you wait for the moment to pass. Now that you know some steps you can take toward feeling better, now’s a good time to remind you that you’re not alone in your experience. It may be comforting to read about other people’s journeys as well.

You might have seen the phrase “feeling emotionally numb” on a list of common symptoms of various mental health disorders. But what does that really mean? Feeling numb inside is different for every individual. In general, people describe it as feeling empty or dead inside, and not caring about anything—even the things you used to care about a lot.  We all have days when we feel more or less engaged with life and excited about the future. But if you find yourself feeling emotionally numb day after day, for weeks on end, and it begins to affect your daily life and relationships, it might be a sign of an underlying mental health condition. “I feel nothing. What’s wrong with me?” That’s often how people describe what it feels like at certain stages of depression or languishing. The experience of feeling emotionally numb can also include: What does it mean when you feel numb? Feeling emotionally numb commonly arises as an unconscious protective response to feeling difficult emotions, whether due to anxiety, stress or trauma. Experts regard it as a form of dissociation, a process that allows us to unconsciously protect ourselves from emotional pain.  But not letting in our emotions keeps us from processing and healing the cause of those feelings. Moreover, pushing hard feelings away can make it hard to feel anything at all—whether that’s love, happiness, surprise, or even interest. Over time, detachment from our emotions can affect our sense of identity, relationships with other people, and even our physical well-being. \n",
      "We cannot selectively numb emotion. If we numb the dark, we numb the light. If we take the edge off pain and discomfort, we are, by default, taking the edge off joy, love, belonging, and the other emotions that give meaning to our lives.  Experts believe that emotions evolved to help us adapt to our environment. From an evolutionary perspective, positive emotions encourage us to seek out experiences that are beneficial for survival, like connection with others and sexual intimacy. Negative emotions motivate us to avoid or escape situations that pose a threat.  Our emotions are meant to fluctuate as part of our stress hormone response system. We should feel a surge when we need to take action and be able to downshift when the threat has passed. Problems arise when we lose the emotional flexibility to respond to the circumstances of the moment. Both heightened reactivity and blunted emotions are associated with a number of mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder.  Emotional numbness can also be a sign of schizophrenia, depersonalization/derealization disorder, or dissociative identity disorder. Genetic predisposition and personal life history may cause disorders like these to develop as part of an individual’s response to stress and trauma. The body’s stress response system evolved to protect us from life-threatening experiences. When it’s functioning well, it produces a rush of hormones and physiological responses that help us get through a challenging situation and then subside once the situation is resolved.  But chronic or overwhelming stress can swamp the system and trigger a state of collapse (including emotional numbness). This state can be produced by specific events, such as an academic deadline, the end of a relationship, or serious illness. Or it can result from ongoing stressors like prejudice, community violence, or financial insecurity. An acute trauma, such as a car accident, an assault, or a natural disaster, can also trigger an intense stress response. This becomes problematic when the protective reflex persists long after the event has passed. That’s why feeling numb can be a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Childhood trauma has also been linked to lingering forms of dissociation later in life, including emotional numbness. Because children don’t have any other way to protect themselves, the body and mind unconsciously turn off emotions to avoid pain and fear.  Furthermore, if a child has learned through experience that their expression of emotion will trigger anger in a caregiver, they may develop a fear of feelings in general. This is sometimes termed “affect phobia.” Emotional neglect, when a child’s emotional needs are ignored, invalidated, or unappreciated, can be just as harmful. All calls are always confidential. In a 2023 survey, 50% of young adults said they are so stressed they feel numb. Fortunately, the human mind and body are resilient, particularly in young adults. And our natural tendency is toward feeling all of our emotions. Start by gradually opening yourself up to letting in both difficult and joyful feelings. The support of a mental health professional is key. Working with a clinician in therapy or a treatment program can help young adults understand why they needed to protect themselves with emotional numbness, and begin healing those underlying issues.  Here are some ways to start moving back toward feeling your emotions, while protecting your overall health and well-being. If your system has been working hard to protect you from the intensity of your emotions, you will want to start exploring them again gently. Music, books, and movies can be a good way to feel emotions vicariously as you work up to facing your own. Explore the different words for emotions (this chart from Brené Brown may help) and practice applying them to those art-induced emotions. Pay attention to the sensations those vicarious emotions produce in your body—that will make them easier to recognize as they occur in your own life. Notice when you experience glimmers—micro moments of positive emotion that may be fleeting, but are still powerful.  It’s easier to face challenges when your system has what it needs to function properly. Unmet physical needs deplete your resilience and make ordinary challenges feel more overwhelming. Paying attention to the three pillars of mental health will make your system less likely to stay stuck in an emotion-numbing stress response cycle. Spend time with people (and pets!) who allow you to be authentic and vulnerable. Learn to recognize what Brené Brown calls “empathy misses”—judgment and blame, for example, but also well-intended minimization or problem-solving that gets in the way of connecting with your experience of emotion. That awareness will help you avoid internalizing other people’s unconscious messages that your feelings are invalid, unimportant, or too scary to face. The techniques of yoga and mindfulness soothe the nervous system, increasing physical and mental flexibility. You may notice improved sleep, better digestion, and many other benefits that support emotional resilience. Just as importantly, both disciplines cultivate a “witness consciousness” that allows a healthy awareness of emotion without overwhelm. Though simple, these practices are not always easy. Be sure to find a teacher who encourages self-compassion. Getting to the underlying causes of emotional numbness is hard to do alone. By the time you get to the point of feeling emotionally numb, your system has been trying hard to keep you from facing your feelings for a while. A mental health professional trained in trauma-informed care can help you to safely uncover what’s catalyzing your emotional numbness, and address the original trauma or stress that triggered it.  At Newport Institute, we treat young adults using tailored treatment plans designed to support their unique needs and past history. Young people in our care heal the underlying causes of emotional numbing while gaining self-knowledge, self-care practices, and life skills.

      "Login Login The phrase \"dead inside\" is popular across the internet. Memes, jokes, and popular media have been created around the phrase \"dead inside\" so we can collectively cry and laugh at the concept of feeling empty inside. But underneath the humor, what's actually going on? The word \"empty\" may imply that this is just a feeling of nothingness. However, it goes beyond just a lack of feeling. A 2021 study1 of people with bipolar disorder dealing with feelings of \"chronic emptiness\"' found it was largely experienced as \"a feeling of disconnection from both self and others, and a sense of numbness and nothingness which was frequent and reduced functional capacity.\" The researchers also found the feeling of emptiness was closely associated with feelings of purposelessness and unfulfillment, and most people in the study found the feelings to be \"distressing.\" That impact on your daily life is what mental health professionals are concerned about. Although it's common to feel empty from time to time, it is not a pleasant experience and can negatively affect how you live your life. There may be cause for concern if this feeling of emptiness, paired with a lack of motivation or enthusiasm for life, is persistent across many or all parts of your life. There are a few possible root causes for feelings of emptiness: A recent experience of trauma can lead to feelings of emptiness, according to Steph Tuazon, LCSW, a licensed therapist who specializes in trauma work. \"A traumatic experience is an experience that threatens safety, sense of self, and causes lasting distress. After a traumatic experience, whether a recent event or a retriggering event reminding you of an event from the past, it can lead to feeling empty,\" she explains. Studies have shown that trauma can be stored in your body, so feeling physically empty might be your body's way of telling you that it needs protection. Coping mechanisms like numbing and disconnection can be used to survive through negative life experiences like loss, trauma, or other highly distressing events. Sometimes, it's easier in the moment to emotionally detach yourself from an experience rather than emotionally engaging with the situation. Burnout can happen in many areas of life. Researchers describe burnout2 as being characterized by: Whether it's related to a personal relationship, caretaking, or professional work, burnout can affect anyone. The feelings of emptiness can be a result of elevated negative emotions for a prolonged period of time. Without the proper tools to navigate complex emotions, it's common for people to push their emotions aside. If you are having trouble identifying sadness from anger or frustration from anxiety, you may become apathetic as a way to deal with your emotions later. \"When we are physically, emotionally, and energetically depleted, we naturally will have difficulty feeling like ourselves and have minimal capacity for the responsibilities in our lives,\" Tuazon says. This is why self-care through sleep, especially during times of distress, is crucial to well-being. When our bodies are depleted, they cannot help sustain us through navigating our lives. If you're ruminating on just how unhappy you are, you might be driving yourself to feel empty. (Here are signs you may be unhappy, if you're not sure.) Unhappiness can cause you to feel unmotivated to care for yourself physically, mentally, or emotionally. Feelings of emptiness can impact how you move through your days. Emptiness is oftentimes paired with other negative experiences and emotions like: Living with emptiness can look like just going through the motions. You have a to-do list, you do what needs to get done, but at the end of the day, you have felt no joy, fulfillment, or gratitude from anything you've done. Since everyone's experience with emptiness is different, it's worth noticing your specific experience by asking: Once you have an idea of where and how your emptiness shows up, you might be able to identify with one of the following scenarios: Persistent feelings of emptiness may be cause for concern. \"Emptiness can be a telltale sign that your needs and wants aren't being met,\" says licensed professional counselor Shani Tran, LPCC. \"The first thing is to ask yourself, 'Am I advocating for my needs and wants?'\" Your needs might not be met in more than one area of your life, including work, your marriage, your friendships, or your relationship with yourself. Feelings of numbness can result from overwhelm or trauma. It could be your body's defense mechanism to protect you against feeling tough emotions and feelings you might not be ready for. Tuazon adds, \"​​Numb is a dulling of emotions. While we don't need every sensation or emotion to be polarizing as something good or bad, feeling numb is a form of apathy and strong disinterest in things we typically have interest or care in.\" Feeling tired can be just the physical feeling that you need more sleep. It can also be your body's reaction to a highly emotional or stressful situation or your body's signal that you need to take a few moments to refresh. Feeling tired can also be caused by rumination. If you're holding on to negative thoughts or situations and repeating them in your mind, you may be exhausting yourself. Just as our bodies need a physical refresh with sleep, your mind and emotional body may need to refresh with a spark of joy or happiness. If you have negative feelings or feelings of emptiness after sex, you're not the only one. This experience is known as postcoital dysphoria, and it can present as feeling empty after sex. \"Postcoital dysphoria (PCD) is the experience of negative affect following otherwise satisfactory sexual intercourse,\" a team of researchers explained in a 2011 study published in the International Journal of Sexual Health. \"Individuals who experience PCD may express their immediate feelings after sexual intercourse in terms of melancholy, tearfulness, anxiety, irritability, or psychomotor agitation.\" Due to pleasurable highs and postcoital lows, some people may have feelings of emptiness to cope with the extremes in emotion. There may also be underlying relationship issues, or past experiences of trauma, that are surfacing in response to the heightened intimacy experienced during sex. Crying is an emotional outlet. Letting yourself cry can be cathartic and a healing experience. After a period of feeling emotional, you may experience a wave of nothing. \"Crying takes a lot of energy, and for many of us, while it is a release, it can leave us feeling even more depleted initially,\" says Tuazon. Feeling empty at the end of the day or when you wake up could be a sign of prolonged emotional processing and your body being depleted. Since feelings of emptiness are oftentimes paired with other negative feelings, it could also mean that you are experiencing a mental health issue that should be explored with a licensed professional. Depression is a clinical diagnosis that requires a licensed professional to test for. It's important to note that depression isn't just one thing. It's not just immense feelings of sadness or emptiness. There are many factors that professionals consider before providing a final diagnosis. \"Feeling empty alone does not automatically mean it is depression,\" says board-certified psychiatrist Pia Quimson-Guevarra, D.O. \"However, if you feel empty along with other symptoms such as having a sad or depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, decreased interest or pleasure in activities, weight changes, fatigue, concentration difficulties, sleeping difficulties, subjective feelings of moving or thinking slower or faster, or thoughts of death or suicide, it could be depression.\" If you suspect you may be dealing with depression, consider finding a therapist who can support you in managing your symptoms. If you are considering harming yourself or someone else, call 9-8-8 (in the U.S.) to be connected with confidential support from the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline or text HOME to 741741 to get connected to Crisis Text Line. \"Examine what things you can add to your life to bring more positivity and love,\" Quimson-Guevarra recommends. \"Do you need more connection? Then try reaching out to loved ones or making new connections. Are you feeling like all you do is work? Try to add more time for rest and meaningful hobbies or activities. Work on adding more moments of joy in your life.\" There are many reasons you may become disconnected from your emotions such as experiencing trauma, not yet having the right tools for emotional processing, and possibly being emotionally unavailable. But the more familiar you can get with your emotions, the more accurately you can identify what is causing your feelings of emptiness. For example, getting really specific about how anxiety shows up in your body: This can feel like churning in your stomach followed by shortness of breath, which leads to feelings of overwhelm, then emptiness. Knowing these signals can help you have a deeper understanding of your emotions. Once you know how to describe your experience and emotions, keeping a journal can help you express and track what's going on in your life. Not only is it cathartic to get thoughts and emotions on paper, but you can also look back to try to find patterns and root causes for your feelings. Tran suggests doing things that created happiness in the past, such as: Reminding yourself of what has worked in the past can help spark some inspiration to get into action. Getting your body, mind, and emotions moving forward is key to getting away from feeling empty. Aiming to improve on adding more joy and happiness first takes realization of what joy and happiness means for you, and this may take a bit of work. Tuazon recommends starting small—even if it's engaging in something that brings you joy for just 30 seconds—and then building up the practice and staying accountable to it. \"Accountability in this sense means being intentional about creating this structure daily versus based only on feeling or convenience,\" she explains. \"One thing I would try to avoid is consumption without any mindfulness,\" Tuazon says. \"For example, while watching a TV series may bring a sense of joy initially, spending hours without being intentional can often lead to feeling worse.\" Choosing an activity that you can engage with mindfully and with intention will help alleviate feeling empty. Springing into action may feel like a big jump while feeling empty. So be kind to yourself. \"Practicing and feeling joy may be challenging, so please give yourself grace in this and know that this feeling empty is not permanent,\" Tuazon says. Sometimes you are taking action for yourself, but it doesn't feel like it's helping you make meaningful progress. You still feel like your feelings of emptiness are impacting the way you live and negatively affecting your work, home, and relationships. The biggest sign that it's time to seek help is if your feelings of emptiness are debilitating, causing you to not perform at work, neglect tasks at home, and turn away from your relationships. The good news is that you don't have to keep moving forward alone. Resources are available. Reaching out to a licensed professional can help get you past chronic feelings of emptiness. A therapist can serve as your guide to get you unstuck and moving forward. Feelings of emptiness can mean many different things depending on the context of where and when you're experiencing it. Taking a moment to reflect on possible causes for emptiness may be worthwhile to gain a better understanding of what's going on emotionally. Possible reasons for feeling empty are experiencing trauma, rumination on negative emotions, or feeling dissatisfied with life. Feeling empty is common. However, the severity and pervasiveness in your life are what you need to look out for. If you feel empty and it's affecting your ability to live your life fully, it may be a more serious situation to get checked by a licensed mental health professional. Feelings of emptiness can be caused by a wide range of things, from sleep deprivation to experiencing trauma to the first warning signs of depression. It's best to work with a licensed professional for a diagnosis. Feeling empty is a common experience for most of us, which is why the phrase \"dead inside\" feels so relevant. However, there are certain contexts where this feeling may point to more serious problems than just feeling empty. It may be connected to life dissatisfaction, trauma, depression, or a combination of things. Depending on the severity of the feeling, you may want to take time with a licensed professional to tease out possible root causes and solutions to alleviate your feelings of emptiness.

      " “It is the way we react to circumstances that determines our feelings.” ~Dale Carnegie We’ve all felt like we’re drowning in mud. You feel stuck, worthless, and confused. You want to move. You should. You have to. But you can’t. And then it evolves into anxiety, fear, and overwhelm. But what if—just what if—being stuck isn’t the problem, but how we perceive it? Every year, I have periods where I feel “stuck.” Yet when I look closer, I see that “being stuck” is a label I give to a natural part of life. It’s a time when not much happens. The anxiety comes when I think it should be otherwise. I start to force myself to work, to come up with ideas, and to make things happen. And when I don’t get anywhere, I call it being stuck. So, what is being stuck except the way I perceive life? As I write this, I’ve been in a stuck period for the last few months. The difference is that I struggle less, because I’m beginning to let it be. You get stuck when you think you should be something you’re not. When you think life should be different than it is. I know I’m trying to force myself to do something when words like ”should,” ”have to,” and ”must” enter my mind. When I relax and surrender to this quiet period in my life, things seem okay. I see that I can’t control life. I can only notice what life brings to me. Being stuck is like quicksand. The more you try to get out, the deeper you sink. My mind wants to push, control, and manipulate. It stems from insecurity. I want to be secure, be loved, and be remarkable. I think that if I could just control life, all would be well. It’s not until I face reality that things begin to lift. Here are three things I do: When you’re stuck, surrender to being stuck. I notice the thoughts and feelings within me that say that I’m stuck, and that something is wrong. If I stay completely in this moment, there is no being stuck. There is only the label of a situation—a label that I’ve invented based on what I think my life should look like. When I notice all this going on, I breathe a deep sigh of relief. But that doesn’t mean that the feelings go away. I might still feel the anxiety, but it doesn’t have a death grip on me anymore. I can see the play of thoughts. I can surrender to what comes. And I still fall into resisting, but I’m getting better at letting it be what it is. I’m getting better at enjoying being stuck. The funny thing is that when we enjoy being stuck, we’re not stuck anymore, because being stuck was all in our head. There’s always something you feel drawn to do during these periods. You’re not completely stuck, not in every area of your life. Right now, I’m reading books. I’m playing with my son. I’m watching movies and TV shows (the British version of Sherlock is amazing). And on occasion, I’m writing articles like this, expressing what I feel. I do the work I need to do. But then I let myself have fun. It’s easy for me to feel guilty during this period because I feel like I’m not doing enough. But I’ve learned to see that I’m doing the best I can. It’s another example of getting stuck in the story that I tell myself. I am who I am. I’m doing what I can do. That’s enough. And right now, that means doing less. The tide will shift soon enough. The same is true for you. Do what you can, but go easy on yourself. At times when I feel truly stuck, I write. I don’t have a system or structure. I get a piece of paper and I write. I like to write by hand, the old fashioned way. It seems to clear my head more than writing on my computer. What I do is write down everything going on in my head. No censoring. No looking back. I let everything come out, especially the nasty bits. The more I do this, the more I notice repeating patterns. I see how I want to change what is, and how futile it is. The more aware I become, the more these things fall away. When you truly become aware of what goes on inside of your head, you start to let go because you see how you create your own suffering. When we resist what is, we suffer. That’s true for anything in life. When I try to change what is, I poison myself from the inside out. But with time, I’ve learned to see my resistance as a sign to relax. To see that I can only do my best with what I have, then it’s out of my hands. There’s no pushing needed. Life lives itself through me, because I am life. I am not separate from anything or anyone. I am this planet. I am the stars. I am you. I sometimes wonder why we think we are not supported in life. We come into this world through a womb, where we’re supported. The trees in the forest are supported. Yet we believe we’re the exception. Are we? I don’t think we are. We just think that life should look different than it does. But the fact that life isn’t what you think it is shows that you’re wrong. Whether you feel stuck for a week or for a year doesn’t really matter. You do the best you can with what you have. But something I’ve noticed is that the longer I’m stuck, and the more I surrender to it, the more I learn when I come out of it. It is the darkest periods of my life that have taught me the most about myself. I’ve learned that life isn’t all about accomplishing things. Sometimes it’s about resting and letting things be. These periods are no different than the seasons. There’s sun. There’s snow. There’s light, and there’s darkness. Once you let it be what it is, things change because your perception changes. But beware of making this another thing you have to do. Be kind to yourself. Let yourself be completely stuck. And let yourself fight it, because you will. It’s all good.

      "Everyone feels sad sometimes, just like everyone can feel joyful, angry, proud and plenty of other emotions. In other words, everyone has feelings, and those feelings are always changing. Sometimes we feel happy (such as when we’re having fun) and sometimes we feel sad (such as when we lose a loved one). Whatever the feelings, it is real and part of living.  A negative emotion may even help you. Our world focuses on happiness and treats unhappiness as an unnecessary or useless feeling. But sadness can slow you down, and make you really think about your life, your feelings and the people around you. It can help you keep sight of your relationships and dreams.  In other words, being sad doesn’t mean you are not coping with a situation. Rather, it helps you come to terms with that situation and move on. It is an important emotion that can help you adapt, accept, focus, persevere and grow. And there’s more good news: you can learn to manage your sadness.  We use different words to talk about sadness: agony, anguish, broken heart, hurt, sorrow, dejection, dismay, homesickness, distress, unhappiness and more. All these emotions can occur in response to a negative or unexpected situations, or life changes.   Sadness often occurs at the same time as other feelings, such as anger, stress, guilt, grief, anxiety or hopelessness. Sometimes, the other feeling may be so strong that you don’t realise you are sad. \n",
      "So what does sadness feel like? It may change how you feel physically. Perhaps you have a stomach ache or a headache, or you can’t sleep.  Sadness may also change how you feel emotionally. Perhaps you are teary, grumpy, bored or frustrated, or just keen to avoid other people.  But recognising your sadness, and understanding that it is okay to feel sad, is a sign of a stable sense of wellbeing.  Life is full of situations that may make people feel sad: When you face these situations, you may have unhelpful or negative thoughts about your sadness. And those thoughts can make you feel worse.  So, try a different approach: try to acknowledge your sadness and the situation that prompted it. And give yourself time to deal with any problems and feel better. You also may want to call on resources that could help you (such as friends and family, a psychologist, or another health professional). Feeling better can involve taking one step or many. It may happen quickly or over a long time. Just remember that emotions ebb and flow, and you can move through sadness to a more positive emotion. First, acknowledge that you are feeling sad. Sometimes sadness may feel manageable, and acknowledging how you feel is enough – after all, it will pass over time. Sometimes you might want to actively do something to help manage your sadness. You may want to try some of these tips: Maybe you know someone else who is feeling sad. Being supportive isn't always easy, because it’s sometimes hard to know why someone is sad and how they are coping.  Here are four basic tips: For more ideas about how to support someone who is sad, read the tips from  beyondblueExternal Link  . Feeling sad does not mean you have depression. But if your mood starts to interrupt your life and how you function, then you may have become depressed.  Key differences between sadness and clinical depression relate to the cause for the change in mood and how long you have felt that way, and other symptoms that might be present.  If your mood relates to a recent event, such as a relationship breakup, then you may well be feeling sadness. But if that breakup was months ago, or you can see no clear reason for your change in mood, you could be depressed, and it might be helpful for you to chat to your GP about what’s causing you to feel the way you do.

      " Overview Sadness is a human emotion that all people feel at certain times during their lives. Feeling sad is a natural reaction to situations that cause emotional upset or pain. There are varying degrees of sadness. But like other emotions, sadness is temporary and fades with time. In this way, sadness differs from depression.  Depression is a longer-term mental illness.

Symptoms of depression may include: You may have some of these symptoms if you are sad, but they shouldn’t last more than two weeks. Suicidal thoughts are a sign of depression, not sadness.  Mental health professionals use the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5 criteria) to help determine if someone is sad or depressed. You may receive a diagnosis of depression or persistent depressive disorder if you meet the criteria. The DSM-5 criteria include nine potential symptoms of depression.

They’ll also want to talk to you about your symptoms. They’ll ask how you’re feeling and what your daily life is like.  Your doctor may also do a physical exam. This will determine any underlying health problem affecting your condition. That could include a blood test to determine if you have an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).

      "Close It’s normal to get the blues every now and then. But it’s not always easy to separate sadness from clinical depression. Learn the warning signs and how to get the support you need. Everyone has sad days. Feeling down from time to time is a part of life. But when that giant storm cloud overhead doesn’t move on, it could be a sign of something more serious. We’re talking about depression. It’s a mental health problem that can negatively affect the way you feel, think and act.1 Depression can make it hard to care for yourself. And that can put your physical health at risk, too. The good news is that depression can be treatable. But it can be tough to know when you have it. People with depression may have a wide range of symptoms. And the symptoms can mimic everyday feelings. Think: irritability, lack of energy and worry. Here’s how to tell if your sadness could actually be depression and how to find the help you need. \n",
      " Work 1-on-1 with a virtual coach or therapist from AbleTo. We’ll tackle sadness first. It’s an emotional state of unhappiness.2 Feelings of sadness can be slight. Or they can be intense and last for longer periods, as with the death of a loved one. Depression is more than just sadness. It’s a mental health problem that doesn’t always go away on its own. Lingering sadness is often a symptom of depression. But it’s certainly not the only one. Depression can make you feel worthless.3 You may even have physical symptoms such as body aches.1 The cause of depression is also much more complex. A stressful life event may spark depression. But other factors, such as the balance of brain chemicals, are also involved. Depression seems to run in families, too.4 To top it off, there are different types of depression. Some are more severe and may be clearer. Others are much more subtle. Everyone’s experience with depression is different. It can come in mild, short-lived episodes. Or it can be life-altering. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe form of depression. And as many as 1 in 6 people will go through it at some point in their life.3 To be diagnosed with MDD, you must have at least five symptoms for more than two weeks. Some of the most common symptoms of MDD include:1,2,3 If you don’t meet these criteria, you can still benefit from support. In fact, there’s a milder form of MDD called subclinical depression. And it can still impact your physical and mental well-being.5 Another type of depression is persistent depressive disorder. It’s said to be milder than MDD.1 But it lasts for so long that feeling down or low can seem normal. (And it certainly is not.) If your symptoms linger, it might be time to reach out for help. “We all have down days,” says Nekeshia Hammond, PsyD. She’s a psychologist in Tampa Bay, Florida. “But if your symptoms persist for weeks, it could be depression.” Even if you don’t think a mood change is serious, it’s better to be safe than sorry. “Depression is very treatable,” says Hammond. “And research shows that people can reach better outcomes if it’s treated early.” One important sign to watch for? It’s hard to do your usual routine. “When it impacts how you’re functioning, that’s when you should definitely seek help,” says Shara Sand, PsyD, a psychologist based in New York City. It can help to compare your current mood to what you’ve experienced in the past, too. Maybe your irritability over small things escalates quickly. Or maybe you’re withdrawing more from family and friends. Both can be signs that you should reach out for help, says Sand. A good first step is to contact your primary care physician, Hammond says. They can do an exam that will rule out any conditions that could lead to depression. Common culprits include thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. If your doctor thinks you have depression, they can send you to a therapist. They may even do the outreach for you. “Finding a good therapist can be one of the best things you can do to feel better,” Sand says. If you’re not comfortable speaking with your doctor or have trouble finding a therapist near you, you can consider virtual options. Optum has resources that can help. Realizing that you need support from a therapist can be tough. But it certainly doesn’t mean you have any shortfalls as a person. “Just because you’re seeking therapy doesn’t mean you’re damaged,” stresses Sand. It just means you’re having a hard time. And with the right support, you can take the steps you need to get through it.   Sources © 2024 Optum, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "Sadness is an emotion typically characterised by a plethora of accompanying feelings, like loss, disappointment, disinterest, a low mood, helplessness and hopelessness. Causes and perceptions of sadness can vary across cultures, as the ideas of loss and expectations of oneself and others differ slightly from culture to culture. Though it’s causes vary, the symptoms of sadness are generally the same from one individual to another, and include a low mood, lethargy, social withdrawal, periods of crying, and distractedness. It’s common to judge or label a given emotion as positive or negative. Happiness, for example, is generally considered to be a positive emotion. Equally, sadness is typically perceived to be a negative emotion. Anger is often viewed as an unhealthy emotion. The fact is that all of these emotions play a role in our personal and social functioning, and so all are valid and need not be judged positively or negatively.  Like all of the basic emotions outlined by Paul Eckman in the 1970’s[1], sadness can be said to have an adaptive function. When a person experiences sadness, there is a focus on the event or circumstance that caused that feeling in the first place. It therefore acts as a motivational tool in avoiding that event or circumstance in the future. Another purpose sadness serve is the strengthening of social bonds. Visible sadness in one person can evoke feelings of empathy and acquire support from others, thus strengthening bonds. Anything which serves to encourage and strengthen social bonding may be considered an evolutionary advantage. Humans are relational mammals, meaning that we derive our sense of meaning and purpose from connection with others. Furthermore, emotions that serve social bonding relate to Stephen Porges’ Social Engagement System, which proposes the idea that humans have survived and continue to survive because of the four stages of our threat response system. This system is like a gear-box, with social engagement as our first form of safety. When social engagement is not possible, we become vigilant, scanning our environment for potential threat. If a threat is present, we activate our fight/flight response, in which our adrenaline is increased in order to mobilise our bodies for action, be that fighting the threat or fleeing from it. If fighting or fleeing are not feasible – because the threat is too much to handle, our next response is to freeze. Sadness encourages social bonding through the evocation of empathy. Social bonding is a key element in social engagement, our human approach to avoiding threat. For this reason, we can say that sadness has a survival function. Sadness also serves a personal function. It moves one’s attention and focus towards the self, motivating them to evaluate their priorities. This is related to the motivational functional of sadness mentioned above. An evaluation of one’s wants and goals often follows sadness, as there is a tendency to be aversive to the emotion, It can signal that something is not right’ that a current circumstance or situation is not serving one’s interests, and that one’s behaviours and motivations should be re-assessed. Our outlook on life has been found to be influenced by our emotional state. When a person experiences sadness, they are more likely to process information using data-based processing strategies[2], while a happier person will orient more towards a top-down, or theoretical processing strategy. It would seem that being sad, then, leads people to analyse social information in a more thoughtful and detailed manner than one would if they were happy. Oftentimes when it comes to expressing emotional difficulties, one can be met with the advice: ‘Stop overthinking!’. The question can be asked; are you sad because you’re overthinking or are you overthinking because you’re sad? Just like the other basic emotions, sadness is characterised by physical expressions. A common and reliable sign of sadness is the rise of the inner corners of the brows, the drooping of the upper eyelids and a downward pull of the corners of the lips. Physical sensations associated with sadness include a tightening of the chest, a heaviness of the body, and teary eyes. Sadness also affects a person’s posture. A lowered or hunched back and a downward or distant gaze are typical postural characteristics of sadness. In the brain, sadness has been found to influence activity in the amygdala and hippocampus[3], which are associated with memory. However. It’s unclear whether these memories are responsible for sadness in the present, or if the present sadness is what evokes the memories.  Unlike physical, mental, and behavioural conditions, there isn’t really an evidence-based method of managing sadness. Any approach to treating it, then, is based on it’s subjective appraisal and the state or accompanying conditions of the individual. Most approaches to dealing with sadness come in the form of managing symptoms, discussion and exploration of life purpose and hope, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for the reorientation of negative thinking, spiritual guidance, encouragement of connection with others. Psychotherapy is often employed to mitigate feelings of sadness, as well as pharmaceutical approaches such as antidepressants and antipsychotics.[4] Before any clinical help is used, an individual can benefit from taking an autonomous approach to their emotions. Psychoeducation plays a key role in developing more self-awareness and understanding, which serves to provide an objective view of one’s emotional state, better equipping them to cope. The use of meditation and deep breathing exercises can also help. When we are sad, we often tighten in the chest and the diaphragm. By releasing this tightness through deep, conscious breathing, we activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for rest and digest. Though this may not completely eliminate feelings of sadness, it serves to prevent frustration and panic that may arise as a result of feeling something that you don’t want to feel.

      "         Science       For Your Organization Insight Is it hard for you to tell if you are just sad or, in truth, have depression? Sometimes we confuse the two, even though there are substantial differences. Here, you’ll find out what underlies both concepts and how to easily separate sadness and depression. Sadness: You are sad about something for a few hours at a time. After a negative experience your mood changes, at most for a few weeks. Over time it gets a little better by itself. Depression: Most areas of your life are affected, and you show a combination of depressive symptoms for most of your day during at least two weeks, causing general distress.   Sadness is a basic emotion and a part of what makes us human – everyone knows what it feels like. Experiencing sadness might even be helpful in working through difficult experiences in life, such as rejection, a breakup or disappointment. Depression, on the other hand, is a mental illness. This means that it shows itself in many different depressive symptoms for at least two weeks. The things that once brought you joy or cheered you up don’t help anymore. You feel constantly exhausted and at a loss of motivation. Persisting sadness is only one part of depression! It is likely that some of your thoughts, behaviors, and even physical experiences have changed alongside with your emotions, causing general distress and a fundamental change in your perception and attitude towards life.   Emotions are momentary conscious experiences. They fade with time. If an emotion continues during a phase in life, it does so in lapses. Thus, it can last for a few hours before decreasing, at least a little. Even during a sad period, there are moments in your day where you feel ok. You are able to laugh, enjoy your favorite song, or the presence of a friend. Sadness fades with time – that’s its job. Depression lasts longer however, without proper attention: It persists for most of your day for at least two weeks, to be exact. “Snapping out of it” is not an option. All the symptoms you are having appear to be constant, although they might be worse during the morning. Nonetheless, depression defines your entire day. It seems unthinkable that you will ever feel better again.   Sadness usually is a reaction to something, for instance a painful event. Your sadness is caused by this particular experience and it is a normal and healthy, nonetheless often unpleasant, emotion. But Depression often occurs without any apparent reason. Maybe your life seems like it should be fine. During depression, your symptoms don’t only occur when thinking of a certain event or person. They are present within nearly every situation. Your concentration might be lower. You have a negative view on the future, you possibly feel unreasonably guilty or suffer from a helpless feeling of being out of control. If depression begins after a specific event, it was probably the trigger rather than its sole cause. In this case, your behavior and reaction are out of proportion with the event and it is harmful to you. If disregarded, it can turn into a downward spiral. The loss of a loved one causes a severe grieving response that goes beyond what we call sadness. It is hard to distinguish from depression because symptoms such as loss of appetite and sleeping problems can be a part of grieving. Grief tends to be a long process that comes in waves. Like sadness, grief tends to fluctuate from day to day. Depression does not so much. Usually, grieving individuals tend to accept help and support, whereas people with depression pull back and isolate themselves. Additionally, people with depression can experience feelings of guilt or a decline in self-esteem, while sad or grieving individuals usually do not.   During a sad day or week your mood changes. Your mind might be preoccupied and you can find yourself falling back to sad thoughts. However, you can still go about your day normally. When you are clinically depressed, however, your daily life has become difficult to endure. Your life has changed. Maybe your friends are noticing it too. You might be having a harder time falling or staying asleep. Maybe your appetite or your sex drive has gone down. You might be experiencing lower self-esteem. You have lost interest and joy in your favorite activities, constantly feeling weary and without energy.   It is up to you to say that you are sad. No one can deny that you are sad, it is something you experience subjectively and independently. Depression, on the other hand, has set criteria and requires an official diagnosis. After all, not only the time period is key to the diagnosis, also a specific combination of core and additional symptoms. Consequently, a depression test is necessary. If you are still uncertain, keeping track of your emotions, cognition, and physical experiences can support the detection of depression. MindDoc regularly measures all depressive symptoms. The app, created to help you detect depressive symptoms and episodes, will ask you questions three times a day over the course of two weeks, giving you a sound doctor’s letter at the end of that period. This way you’ll be able to rule out any remaining doubts and gain a deeper understanding of what it is you’re experiencing. This article delves into what a healthy relationship looks like, debunking some common myths along the way. “Everything okay with you? You’re so quiet!” “Why didn’t you go to the party?” “Why don’t you come out of your shell?” Do these phrases sound familiar to you? If so, you may be an introverted person or shy—or both. But what is the difference between introversion and shyness? Every person has thousands of thoughts running through their head every day. For some, this means getting tangled up in looping and repeating thoughts. In this article, we answer the most important questions about rumination. Psychotherapy—yes, no, maybe . . .? People hesitate to start therapy for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is insecurity and fear. This article takes a look at some of the common thoughts people have that delay or push off therapy indefinitely. Download the MindDoc App to help you on your way to a better emotional wellbeing.

      "Millions of people around the world experience sadness or depression at some point in their lives. Feeling sad is an integral part of depression, but they are not the same. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) note that depression is one of the most common mental health illnesses in the United States. Knowing and understanding the differences between sadness and depression can help a person recognize when to seek treatment. In this article, we help the reader make this distinction and suggest treatment options for depression. Defining sadness and depression is important for improving wellbeing. Sadness is a normal human emotion that every single person will experience at stressful or somber times. A number of life events can leave people feeling sad or unhappy. The loss or absence of a loved one, divorce, loss of job or income, financial trouble, or issues at home can all affect mood in a negative way. Failing an exam, not getting a job, or experiencing other disappointing events can also trigger sadness. However, a person experiencing sadness can usually find some relief from crying, venting, or talking out frustrations. More often than not, sadness has links to a specific trigger. Sadness usually passes with time. If it does not pass, or if the person becomes unable to resume normal function, this could be a sign of depression. If low mood gets worse or lasts longer than 2 weeks, the person should talk to their doctor.  Depression is a mental disorder that has an overpowering effect on many parts of a person’s life. It can occur in people of any gender or age and alters behaviors and attitudes. In 2015, around 16.1 million people aged 18 years or above in the U.S. had experienced at least one major depressive episode in the last year, accounting for 6.7 percent of all adults in the country. Symptoms include: In severe cases, the person may think about or attempt suicide. They may no longer feel like spending time with family or friends and might stop pursuing their hobbies or feel unable to attend work or school. If these feelings of doubt last longer than 2 weeks, a healthcare professional may diagnose the person with major depressive disorder (MDD). Symptoms of MDD include: A doctor would consider a person who experiences any five of these symptoms for longer than 2 weeks to have a medical problem rather than a prolonged experience of sadness. For a diagnosis of MDD, the doctor should link the symptoms only to depression and not to another medical diagnosis, such as substance abuse or an underlying condition. Unlike sadness, depression can leave a person struggling to get through their day. Sadness is just one element of depression. Visit our dedicated hub for more research-backed information and resources on mental health and well-being. If a person has symptoms of depression for longer than 2 weeks, they should seek professional help. A physician can help to determine the level of treatment necessary to manage symptoms. Following diagnosis, possible treatments include medication, counseling, and psychotherapy. Medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of antidepressant. These function by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a chemical messenger that helps to improve mood. Examples of SSRIs include citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and sertraline. According to the Mayo Clinic, these drugs can ease the symptoms of depression, although they do carry a risk of adverse side effects. For example, when people first use antidepressants, these drugs present a risk of symptoms deteriorating before they improve. Family members of the person taking the medication should monitor them closely and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have expressed concern that some SSRIs can cause increased suicidal ideation in younger people and may pose some risk to the fetus if taken during pregnancy. As a result of this, the drugs carry a black box warning, which is an important notice on the information leaflet outlining the possible dangers of the drugs. When prescribing SSRIs, prescribers must carefully balance the pros and cons of use. Psychotherapy involves talking to a trained professional. A person can pursue psychotherapy on its own or with the support of antidepressant medications. A therapist can help identify problem areas, teach coping mechanisms, and educate an individual about the realities of the condition. A medical team might admit a person with severe depression to a hospital if they are in immediate danger to themselves, either because of the risk of suicide or lack of ability to care for themselves. Outpatient facilities and psychotherapy clinics can help with long-term care. Depression and sadness are linked but are not the same. Sadness is an emotion that everyone experiences, often after stressful or upsetting life events. Depression is an overpowering and ongoing mental health disorder that can drastically impact on daily living. Specific triggers will often cause sadness, whereas depression may have no identifiable cause. Sadness is a part of depression but more temporary in nature. Seek a medical opinion if sadness seems to continue for a disproportionate amount of time. This could indicate the development of depression. Read this article in Spanish.

      "The thought of going to a funeral used to terrify me. Walking into a room filled with sadness and grief evoked an intense desire not to go. Anxiety was all I could feel as it masked the emotions I wanted to have, like sadness and compassion. I secretly felt ashamed that I didn’t have “the right feelings.\"\n",
      " \n",
      "It was not death itself that bothered me, it was being in the presence of sadness and grief. Why did sadness make me so anxious? Why did it turn me into a vibrating, heart-pounding, emotional mess, uncomfortable in my own skin?\n",
      " \n",
      "I later came to understand that I felt pressure to fix sadness: to say or do just the right thing. I thought I was supposed to cheer up the person suffering, as though they had a problem to be solved. Eventually, I figured out that I could not fix someone’s sadness. Yet, the visceral pressure to fix it didn’t go away and neither did my anxiety. Sadness is a core emotion evoked when we experience loss. When a core emotion arises, it needs validation and to flow. If we push emotions down, the energy they hold gets blocked. Blocked emotions hurt us. Blocked emotions put stress on our mind and body, eventually causing symptoms like depression, anxiety, ruminations, high blood pressure, stomach problems and more. \n",
      " \n",
      "To let emotions flow, we need to feel safe enough to experience them. Learning what to expect when experiencing an emotion helps make the experience more manageable, less scary and even less painful. Feeling connected to another person with whom we feel safe and comfortable is another important factor that helps make emotions bearable. I didn’t know any of these things when I was younger. And why would I? Our culture doesn't teach us what we need to know about emotions.  On my way to becoming a trauma and emotion-centered psychotherapist, I learned to just be with sadness rather than trying to fix it. I learned my presence and willingness to offer support was all I could realistically do. Being there was enough. Some of the other things I learned include:\n",
      "  If someone is ashamed, self-conscious or feels you cannot deal with their emotions, they will likely hide their sadness. This impedes their ability to move through it and feel better. So, it’s important to avoid saying things like “You really shouldn't be so sad” or “Isn’t it time you moved past this?” Problem-solving isn’t typically what people want. Remember your job is not to fix it. I sometimes ask, “Is there anything I can do for you, like make you a cup of tea?”  There is no normal time frame for grieving. Emotions resolve when they are ready. Many of my patients have said to me, “I should be over this loss by now.” I let them know that everyone and every loss is unique as is the time it takes to heal and recover. An invitation to talk is helpful. “If you’d like to talk about your loss (or what's making you sad), I want to listen.”  Sometimes words don’t help. You can convey “I’m here” by just being around.  If you are comfortable, a willingness to offer physical affection can be helpful. For example, some people will accept a comforting hug, a shoulder to cry on or a hand to hold, especially when you invite someone in with a gesture like your open arms or your extended hand.   Helping others flow through their sadness also taught me how to manage my own. \n",
      " \n",
      "When you are sad, try to communicate your needs. \n",
      "Our loved ones cannot read our mind. And, many people feel the way I did: that they are supposed to solve or fix sadness. Your family and friends may seem awkward or defensive in the face of your sadness simply because they don’t know what to do and that makes them feel uncomfortable. Therefore, we need to communicate our needs to the people around us. \n",
      " \n",
      "Take the time to teach your partner and family what you need. For example, let’s say you are feeling the loss from your adult child moving away. Your partner may notice your sadness and try to fix it by saying, “It’s not so bad.”\n",
      " \n",
      "You might say in response, “I am sad. I just need you to let me feel this way. You can help by holding me when I cry and just listening when I need to talk. I don’t need you to say or do anything else. Would that be okay?” Most partners are relieved to get guidance.\n",
      " \n",
      "We can comfort our own sadness to feel better.\n",
      "If we are aware that we are sad, we can help ourselves. For example, be compassionate to your sadness. Don’t put pressure on yourself to feel any different than you actually feel. Sadness and grief are painful enough without adding a layer of judgment or pressure to “get over it.” \n",
      " \n",
      "To help you move through your sadness, validate it. Take it day by day or even minute by minute. Ask yourself what you need for comfort, and give yourself permission to get it. Most importantly: treat your own sadness and grief the same way you would treat others you love and care about.\n",
      " \n",
      "For me, it was a great relief to learn that sadness does not need fixing. Permission to feel our emotions by offering time, space and presence is a wonderful gift you can always give to others, and equally as important, to yourself.\n",

      " Jump to section What does it mean to be content? The benefits of being content How to achieve contentment Is there a difference between happiness and contentment? Filling your life with contentment Spending a day drinking coffee and watching your favorite movie with your closest friends might make you happy.  But a good day doesn’t necessarily mean a good life. And, while you might be an expert at focusing on the positives, you might still be stagnant.  Being honest about this is tough, but are you actually content with your life? Do you love what you do? Are your actions meaningful?  If you hesitated when answering these questions, it might be time to learn how to be content with life. It's something everyone could benefit from learning. Gallup found that 69% of Americans were content with the overall quality of their lives in 2022 — down from 84% in 2020.  Learning how to be content demands you to dig deep and take a look at all aspects of your life to make meaningful changes. This article teaches you how to learn to be content, the benefits of being content, and the differences between happiness and contentment.  Being content with your life means that you're satisfied with what you have and who you are. Instead of comparing yourself to others or wishing you had a different life, you feel you’re living a life you can stand behind. You accept yourself as you are today, and you value all the opportunities and experiences you’ve had.  Rather than wish that things could be different or resent how your life is going, being content with your life means you: Are filled with inner peace Show love and gratitude to people around you  Feel you’ve found your purpose  Have grown across the stages of life, along with any adversity you’ve overcome  View your mistakes as learning opportunities  For instance, maybe you had a career in marketing for a decade before recognizing that marketing wasn’t meaningful to you. After changing careers to pursue your passion for environmental science, you live more purposefully. But you reflect on your past experiences with gratitude because they brought you to where you are today. What makes a meaningful life to you could be the complete opposite for someone else. Your contentment relies on your specific needs, interests, values, and goals. And you don't need to prove your contentment to anyone else. You don't have to post about it on social media for it to be real.  \n",
      "\n",
      " The benefits of being content extend beyond having a smile on your face. Being content fills you with positive emotions, helps your self-esteem, and furthers your well-being.  Here are three reasons why contentment is important: It fosters healthier, stronger relationships: When you're content, you have greater self-awareness and better understand how to communicate your emotions and thoughts. This improves your relationships because you know how to listen to others, navigate conflict, and show your appreciation.  You experience less stress: Stress is a key predictor of life satisfaction. The less stress you have, the greater your contentment and well-being. Being content shows you what's meaningful to you, which includes your health. That way, your health can become your top priority, and it’s easier to remain at peace and experience less worry or stress.  You have better sleep hygiene: When you're satisfied with your life, it’s easier to get a good night’s sleep. Research has found that good sleep hygiene correlates with sustained attention, clear thinking, and emotional regulation. Sleep is when your body recharges and works to fight illnesses, so your physical health is better because of how you sleep.  Living a contented life isn’t a one-time achievement. It’s something to incorporate into your daily life. You won’t create a meaningful life by putting in work for several weeks. Contentment demands sustained effort, including strategies and habits that’ll become part of your routine. After a while, they might become second nature.  Here are six strategies to help you learn how to be content in life: Practicing gratitude helps you focus more on your positive emotions and reminds you of what’s meaningful in your life. One way to be more grateful is to start journaling, expressing and recording your thoughts in whatever style or voice you want.  While journaling is often private, you could also share what you’re grateful for with friends or loved ones. Studies have found that sharing positive experiences with others amplifies positive emotions and leads to greater life satisfaction. It highlights what’s meaningful in your life and how enjoying it makes you feel. Everyone finds different things meaningful or purposeful. That’s why when you’re living a contented life, you remain your authentic self. Why try to be someone you aren’t? Deepen your self-knowledge and understand what you love in life to stay focused on what’s valuable to you. Keeping your friends and loved ones close improves your social health and ability to deal with life’s challenges. Research shows that your support system helps you problem-solve, manage stress, and improve your self-esteem. Your people support you through your highs and lows. Even if you live far away from your loved ones, make an effort to talk to them regularly over the phone, via video calls, or instant messaging.   Your goals reflect your dreams and ambitions in life. They contribute to a more meaningful life — one where you feel satisfied with your accomplishments. Try using the SMART goal-setting method to help you set purposeful goals that align with your values. If you’re struggling with life planning, try setting short-term goals to boost your confidence and keep a realistic to-do list.  Taking care of your physical and mental health is about more than just feeling good for a day. You aren’t set up for a long, peaceful future without a healthy mind and body. Start thinking of mindfulness practices that’ll help your mental health, like meditation and yoga, to keep your stress low and your mood up. For your physical health, think of ways to move your body that feel good and eat foods that fuel you. Dwelling on your past won’t help you live in the present. But letting go of the past lets you focus on the present and future. Pay attention to what you have to appreciate. It’s not an easy thing to do, but you can let go of the past in small ways. You might do this by forgiving yourself for mistakes or acknowledging that you have lots of life ahead of you to experience.  Even happy people may wonder, “Why am I not content?” Happiness and contentment are often used interchangeably, but they’re different states of being. While happiness is a fleeting moment, contentment is a mindset you carry everywhere.  Learning about more differences will help you learn how to be content in life. Here are a few ways in which contentment and happiness are different: Happiness is influenced by external factors, whereas contentment is influenced by both external and internal factors Happiness sticks around for a short-term basis, whereas contentment is more long-term Happiness is an emotion, but contentment is an attitude and state of mind Happiness is a reaction, whereas contentment is a lasting calmness that stays with you Discovering how to be content with life may feel daunting. You have to think about what’s meaningful to you and how you want to follow your purpose. Plus, you need to accept who you are as you are rather than try to change yourself.  Most notably, when you learn how to practice contentment, you learn that being happy for a day isn’t enough. You want to be content with your life as a whole and develop an attitude that stays with you long into the future. You won’t wake up tomorrow and be content. It takes effort, self-awareness, and dedication. It’s your journey to finding inner peace, so enjoy it. Even though it takes time and demands you to look within, contentment is worth every ounce of effort you put in. \n",

      "Contentment is tricky. Being content means being in an emotional state of satisfaction, typically drawn from being at ease in one's situation, body and mind. It means accepting your situation and feeling a sense of happiness where you’re at. Contentment doesn’t mean you’re not ambitious or don’t have dreams or don’t want more in life. It simply means you don’t get so caught up in achieving the next milestone that you’re unhappy with where you are in the present.  Contentment is tricky because it’s hard to achieve in our current society. That’s because our society has created unspoken rules about what success, beauty, and dignity looks like, so that people who have not aligned with those societal standards tend to feel like they’ve missed the mark somehow and that naturally stirs up discontentment and unhappiness. That’s because we all want to fit in and feel accepted and compare ourselves constantly to how we measure up to what society says is good and right and our alignment with those standards.  That comparison habit is often at the root of discontentment—but not always. Sometimes, we’re discontent because we’re resentful of the family we were born into, perceived mistakes from our parents, we feel like we’ve never been given a fair chance, or enough resources to live the life we’ve always dreamed of.  You’re not alone. That feeling of mild unhappiness with our lot in life is often a communal feeling. But that feeling can rob us of our joy in life and lead to bitterness. Here are 8 ways you can become a more content person. This will take some time and plenty of honesty with yourself, but the best way to become more content is to figure out what’s stealing your happiness in the first place. We recommend journaling for a few weeks and ask yourself the question, “What makes me displeased with my situation in life?” Then keep asking why. Try to determine exactly why your job or your relationship or your physical appearance make you discontent. Figuring out the root of your negative feelings is the only way to truly address any potential issues, so be honest with yourself about the deep, rooted cause for your emotions.  Once you understand the source of your discontent, work on balancing a feeling of happiness with your current situation and a desire for a better future situation. It’s a tough balance, but it is possible to be happy with your current weight while working toward a more toned body. It’s possible to be content with and grateful for your stressful job while interviewing for a new role. You can still mourn a break up while being excited for being in a healthier relationship one day. Take time to pray, meditate, and journal about your desire for contentment and for resilience on the tough days when you feel beat down by your current situation.  Gratitude is a muscle, and like all muscles, we can make it stronger by exercising it. A huge part of contentment is recognizing the good in your circumstances. We’ll pause to acknowledge that not all situations are worth being content with. If you’re in an abusive relationship of any kind, if you’re struggling with mental health struggles, facing an unplanned pregnancy or any other incredibly overwhelming situation, your top priority should be to get the help you need. However, if you’re not in a particularly distressing situation, prioritize contentment by prioritizing gratitude. When you feel burdened by life, pause what you’re doing to think about a few great things happening in your life at the moment. We recommend making your gratitude tangible by journaling it or writing sticky notes to post things you're thankful for around your home or office. These small stickies can be a helpful reminder that not everything is as bad as it seems and there are still plenty of great things happening in your life. You can also practice gratitude with others. People are not obligated to be kind or generous with us, so when you see people treating you with kindness, tell them how you’re specifically thankful for them.  Be consistent, friend. These tiny, ongoing exercises in gratitude will help grow your contentment over time. Social media is a fun tool that helps us connect with the world at large and our closest friends all at once, but its constant stimulation can leave us feeling incredibly exhausted. Plus, people tend to show their best selves on social media, but we tend to compare those manicured versions of people with our everyday life—that comparison often leads us to diminish our own self-worth and achievements because our lives often feel insignificant compared with what we see on social platforms. It doesn’t help that companies run ads on social channels that exploit our insecurities in order to sell their products.  Do yourself a favor and leave the apps for a while; try one day each week or even one week each month. If you get into the habit of leaving social media periodically, you’ll realize you feel better and get a lot more time in your life without it. The truth is, there are things in life that we can’t change, for better or worse. Some are mistakes we’ve made, your family, or traumatic experiences. Unfortunately, living in unresolved unhappiness only anchors us to the past and to things we can’t change, and makes it hard to move on. No one willingly wants to dwell on things they can’t change, but many of us focus on the aspects of our life that will always be the same. The tricky part is honestly challenging what we can and can’t change. We know we can’t change anything that happened in the past, how we look, the family we were born into, the education we got as kids, loans we inherited, or genetic illnesses.  Focusing on things out of your control makes it impossible to be content in life. Time to move forward, which is easier said than done. While this work is all internal, invite your close friends or family to help keep you accountable. Or talk to a counselor. These members of your support system can kindly remind you when you’re saying or doing things that show you’re still dwelling on things you can’t change. Give them the freedom to call you out on hard things so you can truly leave unchangeable realities in their proper place in the back of your mind. Instead, focus on the things you can change by pursuing good and reasonable goals for your life. For the things you can and want to change, start working toward tangible change. It’s hard being content if you’re not actively pursuing your goals. That’s because feeling content without striving for personal milestones and growth can leave us feeling stuck and unhappy over time. Goals keep us moving and active, keeps our minds stimulated, and engages that part of us that wants to pursue passion projects. And goals help keep us grounded in reality and what we can reasonably achieve as opposed to feeling discontent over not having the perfect life we’ve always imagined.  If you don’t have personal goals, it’s time to develop some. Don’t take this process lightly. Clear an evening and reflect on what you want in life and why, and decide which goals you want to pursue right now and which ones you want to delay for the future. Make them realistic and give them timelines to work toward. We recommend posting them somewhere visible in your home so you’re always reminded of what you’re working toward. Discontentment can ruin our lives. More so, they can make each day feel more frustrating and displeasing than the last.  For many, discontentment makes it difficult to push through work days, leading to life feeling hopeless, monotonous, or overwhelming because we constantly feel unhappy with our circumstances.  Find activities that make you feel happy and excited because it can offer a healthy distraction from your feelings of frustration and discontentment. Here are some things you can do to break up your tough days and give your that emotional boost you need when things get tough: * Plan a short road trip with a close friend * Try a new restaurant each week to help you explore your city * Pick up a new, creative hobby like painting, pottery, or interior decorating  * Get houseplants to care for, watch them grow, and beautify your space * Go to concerts * Try cooking or baking new recipes each week * Pick up reading or writing * Journal daily * Try something new and scary to break out of your comfort zone. A common fallacy is that material things and personal achievements increase happiness but that’s not true. In fact, getting more things often makes us feel worse than expected. A similar effect happens when we hinge our happiness on personal or professional goals; we see that all the time with celebrities who have every accolade they could ever want, but feel lost and miserable. Achievements and physical things can make us happier, but only temporarily, so avoid pursuing new feats in an attempt to make you more content. Instead, check your motivations and if you believe that material possessions and achievements will make you more content, shift your perspective.  Remember, it’s still good and healthy to pursue goals, but remind yourself consistently that it’s crucial to find true happiness where you are now. You might spend a long time in your current situation, so why live miserably through it when you can try to be happy with where you are while you strive for the next big thing? When we’re unhappy, we tend to sacrifice sleep, exercise, and healthy eating; this can leave us feeling unmotivated and stressed. One of the foundations to great mental health is taking an all-rounded approach to health and well-being. When we’re physically healthy, we tend to be more emotionally and mentally steady, in turn leading to a happier disposition over time.  Get 8-9 hours of solid rest each night if possible to approach each day with mental clarity and less emotional strain. Eat as many balanced meals and get as much exercise as you can. Physical health starts with what you put into your body and what you do with it. Cardio exercise helps keeps our body oxygenated and high-functioning while reducing fatty, sugary foods can prevent things like lethargy and sugar crashes. Time in nature has a calming effect, reduces stress, improves physical well being, and even boosts your self esteem. Try taking short walks at sunrise or sunset to enjoy the beautiful colors in the sky or take short hikes.  Spend time alone during each week. This will give you time to reflect on where you are in life and all the things you have to be grateful for. It’ll also help you destress if you’re able to really quiet your thoughts and practice mindful meditation. Simple practices like sudoku, reading, and crossword puzzles can help improve our reasoning and critical-thinking skills, in turn keeping our minds healthy! Try new, creative hobbies to give you an outlet for your emotions. Many people use tangible hobbies like pottery, painting, and playing music to help them relax, put things into perspective, and regain their positive disposition. At the end of the day, if you feel better physically, you’ll feel great mentally and emotionally. Becoming a more content person is certainly within reach for you.

      "Language One of my fondest memories is from when I was just about six years old. A promise from my father that my mind hasn’t let slip away— “I will make you discover the whole world.” I don’t know if covering the entire planet is something my to-do list can handle, but at the age of 23, I’ve somehow—maybe even through simple manifestation—had the privilege to discover more countries than my years on this beautiful Earth. I’m on a road trip writing this blog, and I can say that I feel liberated. Travel expands our capacity for wonder, joy and appreciation of the amazing diversity on our planet. Having a moment to simply ‘be’ allows us to let go of stress and tension and just enjoy being in the moment. Travel is my one and only Guru for many reasons—and a few of them I’d like to share.  Travelling helps us feel like our best selves because we’re more willing to receive the world’s many lessons, no matter their shape or size. It helps us recognise our shared humanity with others while dissipating fear or misunderstandings. After all, it’s way more fun to love the world than to be afraid of it. The best alternative to gaining knowledge from a book is travelling. According to neuroscientists, when we travel, we rewire our brains. This is because new experiences are the key to building new neural pathways in the brain. By rewiring your brain, you become more creative and accepting of new ideas. This is why travel makes you happy. It also takes us out of our comfort zones and inspires us to see, taste, and try new things. It constantly challenges us, not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings but also to engage with different people. Engaging with people of all kinds gave me a sense of humility and compassion. The happiest people are the ones with the strongest connections to others, be it family, friends or the general community. One of the best ways to improve these relationships is by travelling together and experiencing new things together. You will find that it creates an opportunity to have some of the most important memories of your life, and this level of connection does wonders for relationships.The pleasures of discovering new things and the joy that comes with meeting new people or the thrill of eating new foods all come together to create a feeling of happiness in any traveller. My favourite lesson was that the body and mind are not separate entities. Travelling improves your mental health by helping you feel calm. Taking time from work to see new places releases the stress you’ve been holding on to, so much so that the feeling can only be described as feeling alive. Studies have shown that we value our experiences more than any material possessions we may own. Spending money on a new experience is more important than buying something new because the experience stays with you forever and you can take it with you wherever you go. This is why when people are reminded of the good experience they had before, they instantly become much happier. As we age, this phenomenon only increases. Our overall satisfaction with experiences increases while the joy and satisfaction we get from buying new things reduces. My second favourite lesson is, like anything in life, it’s not always rosy. During my first few travelling experiences, I went through an array of different emotions. From excitement to nervousness, lingering doubt, a sense of accomplishment, boredom, self-confidence, I felt them all. Feeling so many emotions can be quite taxing, but one must remember that this creates an opportunity for growth as it's not about not feeling emotions, but about being able to understand them in order to understand oneself. You’ll be able to explore new places and cultures and discover the different ways that people live around the globe. You’ll discover as much about yourself as you do about the world, feeling truly complete. Your confidence will grow and you’ll realise how capable you are of taking charge and getting out into the world. further  - 12/2022 As much as we all love exploring the world, living out of a suitcase for too long can leave us feeling a little bit homesick.

      "Share the article There’s no doubt in our minds that travelling is good for our morale. Going on vacation keeps a smile on our face, before, during and long after departure. What’s more, the benefits – and memories – we gain from travelling are numerous. Here are 10 reasons why travel makes us so happy. At least, that’s the assumption we’d like to make after discovering the results of a study done by Cornell University in 2017. According to researchers, spending money on experiences, rather than on physical objects, makes us happier. The reason? We “adapt” to objects, which means that the happiness we feel following a purchase fades over time once we get used to it. Experiences, on the other hand, continue to bring us joy every time we think about them. According to a study by Booking.com, reported by Marie Claire, 65% of travellers surveyed find that their first experiences abroad boosted their confidence. Amandine Legrand, a psychologist and blogger at Un sac sur le dos, believes that travel is good for self-confidence because it offers many opportunities to excel without external pressures and at your own pace. Travelling, especially solo, is an opportunity to discover our own limits and broaden our horizons. Visiting a new place allows us to reconnect with our inner “selves” and what we really want, without the influence of our entourage. This lets us explore the world, all while exploring ourselves. What we’re trying to say is, the inner journey is just as important as the physical journey! Being able to adapt to any situation is an essential requirement for many employers. The experiences we gain on the road can also be useful at work. Travellers are generally perceived as resourceful and brave. On the road, we quickly learn that cultural references help shape our image of the world. Putting ourselves in someone else’s shoes to better understand them enlarges our field of vision. Engaging with other mind-sets, values ​​and ideas can be unsettling at first, but it ultimately makes us stronger and more open over time. Sometimes, getting away provides much-needed distance in order to see a problem in a new light. We’re not talking about running away from our problems, but rather, giving ourselves a break in order to solve a problem. Being confronted with other realities is also an opportunity to re-evaluate our priorities and learn to put things into perspective. Travelling keeps us healthy! This was revealed by a study done by the Global Commission on Aging and Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies in collaboration with the U.S. Travel Association. According to the results, reported by the Los Angeles Times, women who vacation every six years or less are, for example, more likely to have a heart attack or develop heart disease, as opposed to those who vacation at least twice a year. Travelling to a new country can be difficult if you don’t speak the language. Good thing learning a foreign language is excellent for our neurons, according to a study published in the Journal of Neurolinguistics by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. Some people even say that bilingualism delays the onset of Alzheimer’s disease! Not to mention the fact that mastering one or more foreign languages ​​is a valuable asset on a CV. According to a study done by the Global Commission on Aging and the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies and the U.S. Travel Association, after one or two days, 89% of travellers observe a significant decrease in their stress levels. The challenge remains holding on to this mindset once back home! According to a 2016 survey conducted by Booking.com in 17 countries, 49% of participants stated that travel brings them more happiness than their wedding day did. Maybe it’s because we travel more often than we get married? Or at least, we hope so!

      "Inspired, Tailor-Made Travel to Latin America, Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe and the Polar Regions Travel is good for lots of things, but it can also increase mental well-being - and not just in the short-term. Whether you're traveling for business, on a one-week family holiday, or have sold everything to pursue a life on the road, traveling can make you a happier person by building self-confidence, providing new experiences and memories, breaking routine and allowing you to meet people from all over the world.  Keith Jenkins, founder of the luxury travel blog Velvet Escape and prolific traveller, said: I feel happy when I'm gaining new experiences and insights, and challenging my boundaries. Travel is the perfect catalyst for happiness, as it has allowed me to experience the natural, cultural and man-made wonders of the world. Being in foreign lands, it also continuously forces me to step out of my comfort zone - a great confidence-builder. In my book, travel is the best school there is: I've learned so much about the world and, most importantly, about myself.  Marilyn Tam, entrepreneur and author of The Happiness Choice, was travelling when I emailed her to ask her take on happiness and travel:  I'm travelling right now and yes, I am indeed very happy. I am in Myanmar and learning and appreciating another culture.' Tam worked with Minister of Home and Culture in Myanmar and the first Prime Minister of Bhutan to introduce the idea of the International Day of Happiness to the UN, an annual day which this year falls on 20th March. 'Travel expands our capacity for wonder, joy and appreciation of the amazing diversity on our lovely planet. It makes me very happy indeed. If I didn't travel, I may never have had the opportunity to meet the Minister and, who knows, maybe the International Day of Happiness may not have happened yet. So the next time you find yourself heading out on a shopping spree to lift your mood, why not put that money towards a flight instead? Here are 11 ways in which travel can make you happier:  1. FIND YOUR SELF-CONFIDENCE BY DEALING WITH UNEXPECTED SITUATIONS There comes a time when everyone must deal with an unexpected situation when they're on the road. Even if you plan your trip to the letter, things can take a surprise turn. Whatever happens, there is a way around the problem and knowing that you can deal with these situations is a big boost to self-confidence and therefore your happiness.  2. HAPPINESS IS INFECTIOUS When locals are happy, smiling and friendly, it has an immediate knock-on effect. I found the people of Cambodia and Laos to be notably friendly and cheerful, despite the relative poorness of these countries and the former in particular having a very recent traumatic history. When faced with those big beaming smiles, it's hard to be annoyed at the hassling you might experience at busy sites like Angkor Wat; putting that knee-jerk irritation to one side instantly lifts your mood and is a good habit to take home.   3. BEING AWAY MAKES YOU APPRECIATE FAMILY AND HOME Being away from things we often take for granted -- family, close friends, home -- makes us appreciate them more. Calling home isn't a chore, but something to look forward to: no one enjoys listening to your envy-inducing travel stories more than your parents, so it's the perfect excuse to wax lyrical about whatever place with which you've just fallen in love.   4. YOU MAKE NEW FRIENDS It's much easier to make new friends on the road than it is at home, where people are less inclined to chat to strangers on a bus or strike up conversation in a bar (at least, that's true of London). When people are away from home, there seem to be less boundaries to cross and making friends becomes much easier, whether it's a local curious to know where you've come from or a fellow travellers keen to have someone with whom to enjoy a beer or share a taxi. Social interactions make us happier and increasing our social circle means that we're talking more and meeting different, interesting people, which hopefully means we're learning more, too.   5. DETOX FROM SOCIAL MEDIA Social media can be used for both good and bad, but it's healthy for everyone to have a break from the internet every once in a while. Wi-fi is so prevalent that it's hard to turn off and you can quite often find yourself tuning out whatever amazing place you're in with your face in your phone, checking Twitter, scrolling through your Facebook feed, checking your emails... stop. Turn it off. Better yet, find somewhere with no reception and no wi-fi so that you don't have a choice. It's liberating and allows you to better enjoy the 'here and now', which nicely ties into the following point.   6. GETTING SOME 'YOU' TIME Traveling gives us breathing space that is often lost in our usual day-to-day existence. Having a moment to take advantage of peace and quiet and to simply 'be' allows us to let go of stress and tension and just enjoy being in the moment -- a key focus of meditation and a practice you can take home with you. If you're traveling with a partner, it's a chance to spend time with only each other for company, which is a thought that probably shouldn't fill you with dread.  7. EDUCATION, EDUCATION, EDUCATION Whether it's learning a new skill such as cooking Thai food or learning a new language, travel presents ways in which we can further our knowledge and education. Learning makes our brains more active, which psychologists have found increases our level of happiness - particularly when learning something we find enjoyable.   8. GET A VITAMIN D BOOST Whilst it's a bit of myth that you need to be on a sun-lounger for twelve hours to feel the full effects of vitamin D (20 minutes of exposure to sunlight is enough), there's no doubt that in the same way that the cold and dark of winter makes us unhappy (feeling the effects of seasonal affective disorder or SAD), sunshine and warmth generally put us in a much better mood. A beach break is a great way to relax and enjoy the health benefits of a warm climate. Admittedly, this is more of a short-term boost, but a healthy glow makes everyone feels better and lasts for a few weeks after your trip is over.  9. YOU'RE MORE INTERESTING You don't need to be a 'travel bore' to have a few interesting stories to tell. Traveling throws up a lot of bizarre, funny and sometimes serious situations that relating back to people will make you -- at least -- feel interesting. Making someone laugh is an easy way to instantly bump up your self-esteem, so hold on to those embarrassing memories -- no matter how much they might make you cringe.   10. NEW EXPERIENCES GIVE US MOMENTS TO REMEMBER For most people, travelling is about the new experiences. I will always remember that moment of awe when I stood watching the sunlight leak out over the rainforest around the ancient temple of Borobudur in Java at sunrise, the sky turned a striking shade of violet: it was one of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen. Recalling memories of happiness can sustain a feeling of contentment long after the moment has passed, and new experiences are memories that can stick with you forever.   11. THE EFFECTS OF TRAVELING AREN'T JUST SHORT-TERM Aside from making you happier in the short-term, traveling can make you a much more contented, happy and relaxed person in the long run, too. Of course, most travel enthusiasts are constantly planning their next trip, but when we're at home or past a point of being able to jet off whenever we like, past travels leave us with the memories and personal skills - such as confidence, broad-mindedness, friends and a more worldly perspective -- that make people happy. And that's why travel makes you a happier person.

      "getting started Written By: DiveThru Team  Reviewed By: Natalie Asayag MSW, LCSW The sun? Shining. The birds? Singing. Your mood? Delightful! Feeling delightful is simply the best! Why don’t we talk about this feeling more? It’s not that we WANT to be Negative Nellies, but it can be hard to find moments of joy when you’re under a lot of stress, or just aren’t feeling that happy overall. It’s time we recognize those moments of delight where we can, ‘cause they’re so underrated! So, how does feeling delightful tie in with our mental wellbeing? Wow, great question! And we’ve got answers for you. So, let’s dive thru feeling delightful, how it shows up and how it’s linked to our mental health.  Deeee-lightful. Not a word we use often, huh? It’s kinda fancy for everyday use. As in, it sounds like a response you’d get from an 83-year-old British grandmother after asking how her cup of tea is. Why it’s delightful, my dear! You get the idea. But what does it mean to FEEL delightful, exactly? Dictionary.com defines delightful as “adj. giving great pleasure or delight; highly pleasing.” Okay, taking pleasure in something. That makes sense. We’ve all (hopefully) felt this emotion before! There are sooo many things in life that can make us feel delightful, even the little things like getting a massage after a stressful week and feeling all of those knots and aches melt away. Ordering a pizza ‘cause you just don’t feel like cooking after the day you’ve had. Receiving a super sweet card on your birthday. Cracking a joke that everyone laughs at (‘cause you’re a comedic genius). Or, petting an adorbs lil’ puppy. See what we mean?! There’s delight to be found around every corner! If you’re not really sure what makes you feel delightful, that’s okay! Sometimes we get busy, and we don’t make enough time for ourselves to do things we actuallyyy enjoy. But it’s so important to explore what brings you joy in life! It could be a hobby, an interest, or any activity that you do simply because you like it. No strings attached. Delight can also come from simple moments, like the ones we mentioned above. So explore what brings you delight and incorporate some of it into your daily routine! You deserve it. Your mental wellbeing improves when you feel delightful. Shocker, right? But let’s talk about it…because how often do we get to dive thru happy emotions, not just the sad ones? Exactly. Let’s allow some time for introspection here, mmkay? Here are some of the ways feeling delightful can improve your mental health (spoiler alert: they’re pretty awesome): When we’re feeling delightful, our brains are in a stress-free zone. Our brains release neurotransmitters called dopamine and serotonin throughout the body when we’re feeling delightfully happy. You can call ‘em the Happy hormones! Overall, they just make us feel more at ease and life is good. But wait, there’s more! Let’s look at the physical symptoms too. When we’re feeling positively delightful, we’re pretty fuckin’ happy, to say the least. And you wanna know what happiness does to our physical health?! A lot. Ohhh boy, does it ever have great physical benefits! Check ‘em out for yourself: Yep, you read that right. Happy people live longer, it’s been proven by science! Your body doesn’t go through a shitload of stress when you’re busy being all delightful and stuff, ‘cause it doesn’t have time for that. And when your body isn’t dealing with the burden of stress, it can function how it should. So this is your sign to work some delight into your life, wherever and however you can! Here are some practices for embracing this delightful feeling, in case you could use a lil’ extra help. Emotions are fun, aren’t they? Well…maybe not alllll of them. But we gotta say, we’re enjoying diving thru feeling delightful with you. Before you go, we just have a few practices for you to try out when you get the chance! They’ll help you dive thru and embrace your feelings. This isn’t like homework, we promise. Unless you enjoy homework? Either way, give ‘em a go! Journaling is one of our all-time fave practices for exploring our feels. So, try writing out exactly how you’re feeling and what made you feel this way! Maybe you aced the exam after studying your ass off or got a sick promotion at work. Or it could be something small, like receiving a nice compliment that made you feel all fuzzy inside. Expressing your feelings can give you clarity and feels really great, so jot it all down in detail! Your hand might start to cramp, but so what? 100% worth it. We all have that happy place in our minds. (Ours is Belle’s castle library in Beauty and The Beast!) Whatever your happy place in your mind is, go there! Picturing someplace that makes you feel at peace can help lift your mood and put into perspective what really matters to you. So delightful, right? Showing gratitude for the delightful things that bring us happiness? YES please! Gratitude is simply taking notice of the good things in life and showing them appreciation. That might involve writing a list of things that bring you joy, volunteering in your community, or showing acts of kindness to the people who make your life better. Whatever it may be, gratitude is the gift that keeps on givin’. Wanna know something delightful? Friendship. To quote the Beatles: “I get by with a little help from my friends.” Have any truer words ever been spoken?! We think not. So if you’re feeling delightful, reach out to a friend. Text them, FaceTime them, or ask to hang out. Feeling connected to someone who uplifts you is the shit! They’ll probably be super delighted to hang with you or just have a gab sesh. Meditation is a method that’s been used to relieve stress and improve mental clarity since, like…forever. This practice allows us to slowww down and shift our mindset, which is great when you’re feeling not-so-delightful. But when you ARE feeling delightful, guess what? Meditation is still a great option. It’s versatile like that. If you’re not sure how to meditate, follow a guided practice on YouTube to get you started! Well, we had a delightful time diving thru this feeling with you, friend. In case you didn’t notice, we reallyyyy love talking about our feels around here. So if that’s something you’re into, check out some of our other articles! There are always more emotions to dive thru.   Read More: \n",

      "Subscribe How often do you get to the end of a busy week and relish the idea of doing nothing over the weekend? There are few feelings as satisfying as saying, 'Oh, nothing really,' when your colleagues ask about your evening plans after a stressful day of work, with a new study by David Lloyd Clubs finding that 41 per cent of people asked would rather have a free weekend doing nothing than one filled with plans.  We might ask ourselves, 'Why do I feel happy doing nothing?' and the answer could lie in the fact we're so busy all the time. That same survey revealed that  60 per cent of people can’t remember the last time they switched off and 22 per cent wouldn’t know how to.  “As humans, we’re not designed to be constantly busy or for our brains to be functioning 24/7,” cautions Julie Leonard, founder of The Happiness Club community. Our busy lives need an antidote, and that is why we often feel so happy doing nothing. It's not laziness, it's a necessity. “We need time to decompress, to process our day, our thoughts and our emotions. Rest is essential to complete the stress cycle and reset back to a healthier level,\" Julie adds. Psychotherapist and founder of Luxe Psychology Practice Jade Thomas agrees, adding: \"Resting and doing nothing allows our brains to reset. It helps us to regulate our emotions and maintain the ability to focus. You might also notice it enhances your creativity and helps you make better decisions.\" Jade adds that being too busy too often can be overwhelming and stress-inducing. \"If continued over a long period of time, being busy can lead to burnout and chronic stress which can impact both our mental health and our physical health.\" Chinese medicine expert Katie Brindle agrees, adding: \"Relentless busyness takes its toll on our minds and our bodies. The majority of us are already in a state of depletion; we are overwhelmed with responsibilities and commitments even before we factor in our careers. \"Burnout is real – that chronic physical and emotional exhaustion that can leave us feeling stressed and anxious, sleep deprived and sluggish. We wake up exhausted and go to bed exhausted, so we begin to develop physical ailments which, over time, develop into bigger issues. READ: Why you really need to schedule some alone time this month  \"We see it in our skin, our aching joints, our thinning hair and our disrupted menstrual cycles,\" she cautions of how being busy can impact our health. \"Being constantly busy, rather than allowing us to achieve more, can actually age us prematurely, slowing our productivity, stunting our creativity, robbing us of our joie de vivre and leaving no time for our own needs – it can make us ill and depressed if we are not careful,\" Katie says. In our eternally on-the-go lives, productivity is king, as Dr. Emma Hepburn, author of A Toolkit for Happiness says. “We tie productivity and achievement into our worth, believing pausing and resting are for the weak. This is problematic for our happiness – it means we don’t pause to break, to reflect, or to just be.” When we should be resting, we often fill the gaps with more tasks, activating the body’s drive system, revving it up for action, Dr. Emma explains. “This might bring us a sense of achievement, meaning and even joy. But too much of this revving pushes the system out of balance. “Long-term activation of the system without rest and recuperation leads to stress, which has a negative impact on happiness and health,” she adds. We need to reframe rest. Rather than thinking that doing nothing is lazy and feeling guilty for doing nothing, we need to realise it's essential for our happiness, and lean into the peace that doing nothing brings. \"Rest is different from sleep and is important for our health,” Julie explains. “Rest is a valuable way to take care of our emotional, physical and spiritual needs. \"It helps us create balance in our lives and a sense of peace and calm - all essential components of happiness - and we need to do more of what makes us happy.  READ: What are limiting beliefs and why are they stopping you from feeling happy? “We must rest to recharge and nurture ourselves in order to be the best version of ourselves,” she adds. We need to see doing nothing as productive in itself, rather than as wasted time. “Doing nothing helps our body and brain switch off that revved up response,” Dr. Emma says. Studies show we tend to be more productive - and happier as a result - if we stop and take time out,\" she adds. “Rest is not a waste of time; it is so important for health and happiness that it needs to have priority status. It’s an activity to be planned and appreciated in its own right.” NEED TO KNOW: How to practice gratitude for a happier life: an expert's guide As people who love to jampack their diaries with dinners, events and appointments, scheduling time simply to rest seems silly - but it’s essential, especially if you’re a perpetually busy person. Downtime shouldn’t just be a reward for completing tasks, according to Dr. Emma. “Planning downtime means it is more likely to happen,” she says. This can be in the long term, such as making sure you use all your allocated annual leave from work to ensure you have planned rest periods throughout the year, to daily breaks. “Write your lunch breaks and tea breaks into your calendar – block them off as protected time,” Dr. Emma advises. “Plan what you will do in these pockets that will help you relax.” We all have to-do lists as long as our arms, but what about a to-don’t list? Schedule ‘to don’t’ time each day to focus on actively resting. Listen to a song, read a chapter of your book, or do something small just for the joy. This time should not be spent ticking things off your to-do list. The satisfaction of ticking things off your to-do list makes it tempting to whizz through the jobs, but Dr. Emma advises against this. “Allow yourself pauses between tasks, perhaps go for a walk before you start the next job,” she says. “Give yourself the gift of space, time and opportunity to pause.” DISCOVER: Why you'll never be happy without this one key thing  If working from home has transformed your sanctuary of a bedroom to a place you work, this is all the more important. Carve out an area in your home simply for resting, suggests Dr. Emma. “Places and spaces can provoke particular feelings, and some are conducive to happiness,” she says. She advises us to think of a space where we felt comfortable, where we felt our body relax and recreate this for our resting place. Maybe it has soft pillows, soothing tones or pretty flowers - whatever it was that made you feel cocooned, try to replicate this to create somewhere you want to go for time out. “A study found that those who described their living spaces as ‘restful and restorative’ as opposed to ‘cluttered’ were less likely to be depressed or fatigued,” Dr. Emma says.  WOW: I'm ridiculously indecisive – but this 5-minute trick overhauled my decision-making  Rest looks different for everyone. For freelance PR expert Erica Vonderwall of Colourful Comms, a slow life is key to her happiness. “My own personal happiness is directly linked to how well rested, well fed, and well entertained I am,” she told us. “I make sure those things are all a focus in my day,” she says. “I really enjoy a slow life, and while that's not for everyone, a good book or bingeable TV show make me happy, especially if there's a snoozy dog curled up next to me.” For body acceptance influencer Nelly London, her rest sees her take time away from her phone, while Julie’s rest entails spending time with her family, eating well and exercising. “Reading books and connecting with friends are also important for my happiness, so I make time to focus on them. It helps me to recharge and nurture myself in order to be the best version of myself.”  Learn how to be happier with our HELLO! Happiness Hub\n"

      "Becoming Minimalist Own less. Live more. Written by guest · 41 Comments  Note: This is a guest post from Jay Harrington of Life and Whim.  After a long, brutal winter, it feels great to be outside again in a t-shirt, even if the temperatures aren’t climbing much beyond fifty degrees here in northern Michigan. In our community, which was recently buried in snow, people are out in force, combing beaches for rocks, riding bikes, hiking trails, cruising on paddleboards, and celebrating spring’s arrival. In addition to short sleeves, lots of people are wearing beaming smiles on their faces. Happiness is in the air. This is true despite the fact that the weather hasn’t even been that great—it just seems great relative to what we’re used to. Come fall, however, after a long, hot summer, we will start longing for cool, crisp air, and even (for some of us) the first snowflakes flying which will signal the coming ski season. The cycle of expectations and adaptation will then repeat. As humans, we are always chasing rainbows. We want something—be it different weather, a better job, or a bigger house—but shortly after getting it, we want something different. We adapt to our circumstances, they become the “new normal,” and we want more. We want a happier life. This phenomenon is called “hedonic adaptation.” It’s a term coined by psychologists Brickman and Campbell in the 1970s to explain our tendency as human beings to chase a happier life, only to return back to our original emotional baseline after getting what we want. We run on a hedonic treadmill, and get nowhere, despite exerting massive effort along the way. A belief that “bigger and better” leads to a happier life results, paradoxically, in less of it. We work really hard because we want more. We obtain more, and the shine soon wears off. So we work harder, in pursuit of even more, and become less happy as a result. The beat goes on. It’s clear from the science that the acquisition of bigger and better things doesn’t result in a happy life. So what will? In his book Happier, Harvard lecturer Tal Ben-Shahar defines the “arrival fallacy,” which is a corollary to the concept of hedonic adaptation. He describes the arrival fallacy as: “The false belief that reaching a valued destination can sustain happiness.” I’ve certainly fallen victim to the arrival fallacy, having felt at first elated, then almost immediately letdown, following job promotions, raises, and new car or home purchases. I wanted these things so badly, but the reality of obtaining them was far different than my expectations. In an interesting study from the 1970s, researchers studied the happiness levels of two different groups of people: lottery winners and accident victims. The surprising result of the study was that, once the initial elation of winning the lottery and shock of the accident wore off, both groups returned to their original levels of happiness. Over the long-term, these drastically different external events—one seemingly positive and the other negative—had no appreciable impact on happiness. If winning the lottery won’t make us happier, what will? Ben-Shahar suggests that it is not reaching a particular destination (metaphorically speaking) that makes us happy, but rather learning to appreciate the journey toward the destination: Attaining lasting happiness requires that we enjoy the journey on our way toward a destination we deem valuable. Happiness is not about making it to the peak of the mountain nor is it about climbing aimlessly around the mountain; happiness is the experience of climbing toward the peak. In this sense, ambition, itself, is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s a very good thing. If humans did not want for more then we’d still be living in caves, without access to basic, modern human necessities such as electricity and clean water, nor marvels of human ingenuity such as modern medicine, art, and technology. Problems arise when we allow the unending pursuit of growth and acquisition to inhibit our pursuit of happiness. Both ambitions—happiness and growth—can coexist, but only in balance. Growth can crowd out a happy life if you’re not careful. One of the most important and growing costs of the modern way of life is ‘cultural fraud’: the promotion of images and ideals of ‘the good life’ that serve the economy but do not meet psychological needs, nor reflect social realities. —Richard Eckersley I would, of course, never presume to suggest that I know what makes you, or anyone else, happy. We all have distinct visions, preferences, and desires for our lives. But years of scientific research suggests that certain things make most of us happy. In particular, happiness is not derived from attaining outward signals of success (bigger and better in order to “keep up with the Joneses”), but rather seeking satisfaction from new and novel experiences in pursuit of a life well-lived. What types of experiences pay the biggest happiness dividends? I recently attended a conference in New Orleans and the keynote speaker was the University of Amherst professor, Catherine A. Sanderson, author of Science of Happiness. She is known as “The Happiness Professor.” Sanderson explained that there are 10 ways to increase your everyday happiness, according to decades worth of scientific research: 1. Make little changes in your daily routine, such as getting more sleep, exercising, getting out into nature, and meditating. 2. Read more books. Read books to learn—research suggests that lifelong learners remain healthy and engaged, and live long lives. Read books as an escape from your everyday life, Read books—it will make you happy. 3. Find your right fit or match, both personally and professionally. If you love what you do and who you are with, you’ll position yourself for personal happiness and professional success. 4. Be grateful. Sanderson suggested two specific activities to help foster a greater sense of gratitude. First, keep a daily gratitude journal. Second, pay a “gratitude visit” to someone from your past who has had a significant impact on your life, and let them know how you feel. 5. Smile more—even if you don’t feel like it. Research shows that the simple act of smiling can trick your brain into a happier state. 6. Relish simple, everyday moments. Appreciating life’s small moments, such as a beautiful, sunny day, green shoots sprouting from the ground, and skipping rocks at the beach, teaches you to be more grateful for what you have, especially during moments of stress and angst. 7. Perform random acts of kindness. Do good deeds. Volunteer. Be charitable. Shop (for someone else!). Numerous studies have shown that you can help yourself by doing good for others. 8. Spend money on experiences versus things. Studies have shown that buying an object—a car, handbag, or kitchen gadget—can quickly lead to buyer’s remorse. On the other hand, investing in experiences—a concert, a camping trip, music lessons—leads to greater happiness. Experiences create “happiness residue,” and our perceptions of them often get better over time. 9. Avoid comparisons. Whatever you may think of someone else’s life, particularly as viewed through the phony, filtered lens of social media, it’s almost certainly messier than you imagine. It’s easier to embrace, and learn to love, your own imperfections, if you don’t conjure up myths about how perfect everyone else’s lives seem. 10. Build and maintain close relationships. According to Sanderson, having a small number of tight, meaningful relationships is one of the highest predictors of happiness. Don’t feel bad if you lose sight of some of these happiness priorities—we all do. We have to battle relentless marketing and societal expectations that suggest that the path to happiness lies elsewhere. People are exposed to many messages that encourage them to believe that a change of weight, scent, hair color (or coverage), car, clothes, or many other aspects will produce a marked improvement in their happiness. Our research suggests a moral, and a warning: Nothing that you focus on will make as much difference as you think. —Daniel Kahneman Don’t over-complicate your pursuit of happiness. As the research suggests, it’s the simple things that matter most for a happy life. Make happiness a habit that is within your control, rather than seeking it from external sources. Life is nothing but a series of moments, both big and small, and the key to living a happy life lies is living each one with purpose and intention. *** Jay Harrington is a “reformed lawyer” turned author and entrepreneur, and blogs at Life and Whim where he helps people find purpose and live big through small moments.

      "Regardless of your version of true happiness, living a happier, more satisfied life is within reach. A few tweaks to your regular habits like getting more sleep and exercise can help you get there. Habits matter. If you’ve ever tried breaking a bad habit, you know all too well how engrained they are. Well, good habits are deeply engrained, too. Why not work on making positive habits part of your routine? Below, you’ll find suggestions for daily, monthly, and yearly habits to help kickstart your quest. Just remember that everyone’s version of happiness is a little different, and so is their path to achieving it. If some of these habits create added stress or just don’t fit your lifestyle, ditch them. With a little time and practice, you’ll figure out what does and doesn’t work for you. The following daily habits may help you achieve more happiness in your life. You tend to smile when you’re happy. But it’s actually a two-way street. We smile because we’re happy, and smiling causes the brain to release dopamine, which makes us happier. While not completely foolproof, researchers have found that the link between smiling and happiness could be attributed to the “facial feedback hypothesis,” where facial expressions may have a modest influence on emotions.  That does not mean you have to go around with a fake smile plastered on your face all the time. But the next time you find yourself feeling low, crack a smile and see what happens. Or try starting each morning by smiling at yourself in the mirror. Exercise isn’t just for your body. Regular exercise can help reduce stress, feelings of anxiety, and symptoms of depression while boosting self-esteem and happiness. Even a small amount of physical activity can make a difference. You don’t have to train for a triathlon or scale a cliff — unless that’s what makes you happy, of course. The trick is to not overexert yourself. If you suddenly throw yourself into a strenuous routine, you may just end up frustrated (and sore). Consider these exercise starters: Remind yourself of any fun activities you once enjoyed but that have fallen by the wayside. Or you could consider starting activities you always wanted to try, such as golf, bowling, or dancing. Most adults need at least 7 hours of sleep every night. If you find yourself fighting the urge to nap during the day or just generally feel like you’re in a fog, your body may be telling you it needs more rest. No matter how much our modern society steers us toward less sleep, we know that adequate sleep is vital to good health, brain function, and emotional well-being. Getting enough sleep also reduces your risk of developing certain chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, depression, and diabetes. Here are a few tips to help you build a better sleep routine: If you consistently have problems sleeping, consider talking with a doctor. You may have a sleep disorder that requires treatment. You may already know that your food choices have an impact on your overall physical health. But some foods can also affect your state of mind. For example: If you want to eat with your mood in mind, consider starting with making one food choice for your mood each day. For example, swap a big, sweet breakfast pastry for some Greek yogurt with fruit. You’ll still satisfy your sweet tooth, and the protein will help you avoid a midmorning energy crash. Consider adding in a new food swap each week. Simply being grateful can give your mood a big boost, among other benefits. For example, a two-part study found that practicing gratitude can have a significant impact on feelings of hope and happiness. You might try starting each day by acknowledging one thing you’re grateful for. You can do this while you’re brushing your teeth or just waiting for that snoozed alarm to go off. As you go about your day, consider keeping an eye out for pleasant things in your life. They can be big things, such as knowing that someone loves you or getting a well-deserved promotion. But they can also be little things, such as a co-worker who offered you a cup of coffee or the neighbor who waved to you. Maybe it could even just be the warmth of the sun on your skin. With a little practice, you may even become more aware of all the positive things around you. Research shows that performing acts of kindness may also help promote your overall well-being.  Giving a sincere compliment is a quick, easy way to brighten someone’s day while giving your own happiness a boost. Catch the person’s eye and say it with a smile so they know you mean it. You might be surprised by how good it makes you feel. If you want to offer someone a compliment on their physical appearance, make sure to do it in a respectful way. You’re tense, your shoulders are tight, and you feel as though you just might “lose it.” We all know that feeling. Instinct may tell you to take a long, deep breath to calm yourself down. Turns out, that instinct is a good one. Research supports the fact that slow breathing and deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress. The next time you feel stressed or are at your wit’s end, work through these steps: If you’re having a hard time taking slow, deliberate breaths, try counting to 5 in your head with each inhale and exhale. A positive attitude is generally a good thing, but bad things happen to everyone. It’s just part of life. If you get some bad news, make a mistake, or just feel like you’re in a funk, don’t try to pretend you’re happy. Acknowledge the feeling of unhappiness, letting yourself experience it for a moment. Then shift your focus toward what made you feel this way and what it might take to recover. Would a deep breathing exercise help? A long walk outside? Talking it over with someone? Let the moment pass and take care of yourself. Remember, no one’s happy all the time. A journal is a good way to organize your thoughts, analyze your feelings, and make plans. And you don’t have to be a literary genius or write volumes to benefit. It can be as simple as jotting down a few thoughts before you go to bed. If putting certain things in writing makes you nervous, you can always shred it when you’ve finished. It’s the process that counts. Not sure what to do with all the feelings that end up on the page? Our guide to organizing your feelings may help. Life is full of stressors, and it’s impossible to avoid all of them. There’s no need to. Stress isn’t always harmful, and we can even change our attitudes about stress. Sometimes, there’s an upside to stress. For those stressors you can’t avoid, remind yourself that everyone has stress — there’s no reason to think it’s all on you. And chances are, you’re stronger than you might think you are. Instead of letting yourself get overwhelmed, try to address the stressor head-on. This might mean initiating an uncomfortable conversation or putting in some extra work, but the sooner you confront it, the sooner the pit in your stomach may start to shrink. Whether it happens on social media, at work, or even at a yoga class, it’s easy to fall into a place where you’re comparing yourself to others. The result? You may experience more discontent, lower self-esteem, and even depression and anxiety. It can take practice to stop comparing yourself to others, but it’s worth it for the benefit of having your inner peace and happiness.  You can start with some of the other tips on this list that can help draw your attention inward to yourself, such as deep breathing and journaling. You may also consider talking with a therapist for perspective. The following tips include weekly habits that may help you feel happier. Decluttering sounds like a big project, but setting aside just 20 minutes a week can have a big impact. What can you do in 20 minutes? Lots. Set a timer on your phone and take 15 minutes to tidy up a specific area of one room — say, your closet or that out-of-control junk drawer. Put everything in its place and toss or give away any extra clutter that’s not serving you anymore. Keep a designated box for giveaways to make things a little easier (and avoid creating more clutter). Use the remaining 5 minutes to do a quick walk through your living space, putting away whatever stray items end up in your path. You can do this trick once a week, once a day, or anytime you feel like your space is getting out of control. Humans are largely considered social beings, and while the research is mixed on how exactly socialization impacts happiness, the consensus is that having social relationships can make us happy. Who do you miss? Reach out to them. Make a date to get together or simply have a long phone chat. In adulthood, it can feel next to impossible to make new friends. But it’s not about how many friends you have. It’s about having meaningful relationships — even if it’s just with one or two people. Try getting involved in a local volunteer group or taking a class. Both can help connect you with like-minded people in your area. And it’s likely they’re looking for friends, too. Companionship doesn’t have to be limited to other humans. Pets can offer similar benefits, according to multiple studies. Love animals but can’t have a pet? Consider volunteering at a local animal shelter to make some new friends — both human and animal. Feel like you’re flailing about? Try sitting down at the end of every week and making a basic list for the following week. Even if you don’t stick to the plan, blocking out time where you can do laundry, go grocery shopping, or tackle projects at work can help quiet your mind. You can get a fancy planner or app, but even a sticky note on your computer or piece of scrap paper in your pocket can do the job. Unplug. Really. There’s mounting evidence to support the fact that excessive phone use can lead to changes in the brain and impact your mood, with one review even revealing more serious cognitive and emotional changes in adolescents and young adults.  Turn off all the electronics and put those earbuds away for at least 1 hour once a week. They’ll still be there for you later if you want them. If you haven’t unplugged in a while, you might be surprised at the difference it makes. Let your mind wander free for a change. Read. Meditate. Take a walk and pay attention to your surroundings. Be sociable. Or be alone. Just be. Sound too daunting? Try unplugging for a shorter amount of time several times a week. Spending 30 minutes or more a week in green spaces can help lower blood pressure and the chances of developing depression, according to one study.  Your green space could be anything such as your neighborhood park, your own backyard, or a rooftop garden — anywhere you can appreciate and enjoy nature and fresh air. Better yet, add some outdoor exercise into the mix for extra benefit. The same aforementioned study found that people who spent time in green spaces were also more likely to exercise more frequently and for longer each time. There are many methods of meditation to explore. They can involve movement, focus, spirituality, or a combination of all three. Meditation doesn’t have to be complicated. It can be as simple as sitting quietly with your own thoughts for 5 minutes. Even the deep breathing exercises mentioned earlier can serve as a form of meditation. We’re certainly happier when we learn how to cope with obstacles. When you’re faced with a problem, think about what got you through something similar in the past. Would it work here? What else can you try? If you feel like you’re hitting a brick wall, consider speaking with a mental health professional like a therapist on a weekly basis. You don’t need to have a diagnosed mental health condition or overwhelming crisis to seek therapy. Mental health professionals are trained to help people improve coping skills. Plus, there’s no obligation to continue once you start. Even just a few sessions can help you add some new goodies to your emotional toolbox. Worried about the cost? It’s possible to afford therapy on any budget. It’s easy to neglect self-care in a fast-paced world. But trying to find time to nurture yourself as much as you can is important in supporting your body’s responsibilities of carrying your thoughts, passions, and spirit through this world. Maybe it’s unwinding your workweek with a long, hot bath. Or it may be adopting a skin care routine that makes you feel indulgent. Or it could be simply setting aside a night to put on your softest jammies and watch a movie from start to finish. Whatever it is, make time for it. Put it in your planner if you must, but try to make it a priority do it. You might want to give these monthly habits to improve your happiness a try. If you find that giving daily compliments provides a needed boost to your mood, consider making a monthly routine of giving back on a larger scale. Maybe that’s helping out at a food bank on the third weekend of every month or offering to watch your friend’s kids one night per month. No one to go out with? Well, what rule says you can’t go out alone? Consider going to your favorite restaurant, taking in a movie, or going on that trip you’ve always dreamed of. Even if you’re a social butterfly, spending some deliberate time alone can help you reconnect with the activities that truly make you happy. You arrive for an appointment with 10 minutes to spare. What do you do with that time? Pick up your cell phone to scroll through social media? Worry about the busy week you have ahead of you? Trying to take control of your thoughts during these brief windows of time can offer benefits. At the start of each month, make a short list of happy memories or things you’re looking forward to on a small piece of paper or on your phone. When you find yourself waiting for a ride, standing in line at the grocery store, or just with a few minutes to kill, break out the list. You can even use it when you’re just generally feeling down and need to change up your thoughts. Try following habits once a year or more to reflect and plan for happiness. While the start of a new year is a good time to stop and take inventory of your life, you can set up yearly habits at any point in the year. Try setting aside some time to catch up with yourself the way you would with an old friend: But try to avoid judging yourself too harshly for your answers. You’ve made it to another year, and that’s a reason to celebrate. If you find that your mood hasn’t improved much over the last year, consider talking with a doctor or mental health professional. You might be dealing with depression or even an underlying physical condition that’s affecting your mood. People change, so try thinking about where you’re heading and consider if that’s still where you want to go. There’s no shame in changing your plans. Let go of any goals that no longer serve you, even if they sound nice on paper. You’ve likely heard this before, including several times in this article. Your physical and mental health are closely intertwined. As you build habits to improve your happiness, it’s important to follow up with routine appointments to help take care your body, such as: This can often be easier said than done. But remembering that you are not necessarily doing it for another person or other people may help you be more open to beginning the process. Sometimes, offering forgiveness or dropping a grudge is more about self-care than compassion for others. Take stock of your relationships with others. Are you harboring any resentment or ill will toward someone? If so, consider reaching out to them in an effort to bury the hatchet. This does not have to be a reconciliation. You may just need to end the relationship and move on. If reaching out is not an option, try getting your feelings out in a letter. You don’t even have to send it to them. Just getting your feelings out of your mind and into the world can be freeing. You can even shred the letter afterward if you want to. With an ever-hectic schedule, sometimes it’s easy to forget to schedule something else that’s crucial to your well-being: time off. You can reap even more benefits by planning a trip, whether it’s close to home or somewhere further away. What’s more, research also backs both the mental and physical benefits of taking that much-needed vacation. In one such study, researchers looked at stress and heart rate as it relates to taking a vacation. They found that not only did the vacation itself reduce stress, but the weeks leading up to that planned trip had similar effects.

      "When you make an intentional choice every day to worry less, you will live a happier, more fulfilling life. The impact of your own lives trickles down onto those surrounding you too. Don't get caught up so much with life that you forget to enjoy the things that truly matter. If you would do one thing without receiving a paycheck for the rest of your life, what would it be? Question yourself on why your goals are so important. This exercise helps you determine if you are on a quest after your purpose. One step to finding your purpose is to look within yourself and identify your talents and passion. Find something that the world is in need of such more passionate medical professionals. Align your strengths with the need and see how you can be a problem solver while making a meaningful difference doing it. Time is the currency of life; you are only allowed to enjoy it for a limited period. It’s easy to get caught up worrying about the future that you forget to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. We’ve all been there. You’re travelling on a train but you are deep in thought. Your mind is constantly wandering and contemplating the things you need to get done. Worrying about the unknown will only make you anxious. Training your mind to be present helps you appreciate the time you presently have and enjoy every moment of it. Human beings are highly social creatures that thrive from other human beings' company. Surrounding yourself with those you genuinely care for can have numerous benefits for you as a person. Social connections can help you cope with anxiety and sadness, enable you to be more emotionally intelligent, increase self-esteem and empathy, and even boost your immune systems. Dedicating time to make meaningful connections can have many understated benefits that can be great for overall fulfillment in life.  According to research, the average person has roughly 150 uncompleted tasks that they think about daily. These files are like open tabs on your computer, they not only slow down your Operating System, but also distract you from being productive. The more open files you have the less you get done. Instead of multitasking, setting a schedule to get your work done and organizing the tasks in order of priority not only increases productivity, but also helps you get your life in order, leading to a more fulfilled life. Physical activity is not only necessary to stay fit, but it's also a great way to cope with stress. When you work out, your body reacts by releasing chemicals that make you feel good about yourself while also suppressing tension and anxiety-inducing hormones. Exercise also decreases the activity of the hormones, which induce anxiety and stress, therefore, making you feel better and eventually happy. Creating time to exercise helps you to be more energized, fit and generally happy. Lack of quality sleep can have many consequences to your overall health. You get restless and easily irritable when you haven’t had a proper night’s rest. All this can be resolved when you get quality sleep, experts recommend seven to eight hours as sufficient for adults. However, this may vary depending on your body, some people may be okay with an hour less while others an extra hour helps them feel well rested. Research shows that getting quality sleep will make you more productive, happier and healthier. Excessive clutter can often make your life feel chaotic and cause a lot of stress thus affecting your general outlook on life. It can affect every aspect of your life by weighing you down and slowing you from accomplishing your goals. From outdated apps, damaged furniture, or even social commitments. Anything you have not really used in the last 18 or so months should be cleared. It's not a good idea to let tangible items take up emotional space in your life. Allow it to go. Decluttering your life will declutter your mind as well allowing you to be more peaceful and have the energy for those things that really matter.  Everyone has unique attitudes and perspectives about life. Personal values that you hold dear  to your heart are a great part of what you believe in, thus they are foundational in understanding yourself and the things you care about. Knowing what beliefs and values are important in your life exudes happiness because it motivates you to be part of something bigger. Understanding what we value in life may be a big source of happiness because it inspires us to participate in activities that help us achieve our goals. As human beings, we care a lot about winning. We condemn failure and poor performances and are too hard on ourselves. This has a negative impact on your mindset as it brings you down dampening your winning spirit. Train your mind to appreciate every step of a task rather than the overall goal. Adopting this mindset will help you appreciate both the process and results. Take time to celebrate the small wins in your life. This can be something as simple as not snoozing your alarm clock, taking a lunch break, or even starting a new certification at ProMed. Research shows that altruism is hardwired into the brain. This explains why helping others can make you feel good. You often have heard the saying that, ‘it’s better to give than to receive. Helping others may be the secret to your own personal happiness. The key is to find a passion that aligns with the needs of those surrounding you. When this is discovered, you will be able to assist others by gaining a purpose, meaning, and happiness. \n",

There are choices that you make every day, some of which seem completely unrelated to your health and happiness, that dramatically impact the way you feel mentally and physically. With that said, here are 10 common mistakes that can prevent you from being happy and healthy, and the science to back them up. When the Buffer team explored the science of happiness before on this blog, the interest was overwhelming. So I hope this can provide equally valuable insights: Ultimately, the human experience is about connecting with other people. Connection is what provides value and meaning to our lives. We’re wired for it and research proves just that. For example, people with strong social ties were found to be healthier and have a lower risk of death. Additionally, it was found that as age increases, the people with stronger social ties tend to live longer. And it seems that friendships can even help you fight cancer. The benefits of deep relationships extend to marriage as well. Being in a long-term relationship decreases the risk of depression, suicide, and substance abuse. And one study of almost 6,000 peoplefound that marriage led to increased longevity while never marrying was the strongest predictor of premature death. Finally, multiple studies (here, here, and here) show that strong family ties are one of the primary reasons the people of Okinawa, Japan have incredible longevity despite being one of the poorest prefectures in the country. What do all of these different studies tell us? Connection and belonging are essential for a healthy and happy life. Whether it’s friendship, marriage, or family — humans need close connections to be healthy. For more about the connection between loneliness and health, I suggest reading the New York Times best-seller Mind Over Medicine, which was written by my friend Dr. Lissa Rankin. You might want to stand up for this. The internet has gone crazy over an infographic that describes the harmful effects of sitting all day. The short version is that “recreational sitting” like sitting in front of a TV screen increases your risk of cardiovascular disease and death, regardless of your physical activity. Obviously, sitting at a desk for work isn’t too good either. This troubling data doesn’t come from small sample sizes either. These trends held true in one study with 4,500 people, another with 8,800 people, and a final one with over 240,000 participants. If you’re looking for more details on the health risks of sitting, this New York Times article covers some of the basics. Instead, try getting up and move around, it can be as simple as a quick walk around the desk: A few years ago, I was speaking with a yoga instructor who told me, “I think people love my class because it’s the only time in their entire day when they just sit and breathe.” That provides some interesting food for thought. From the time you wake up until the time you go to bed, do you ever take 15 minutes to just sit and breathe? I rarely do. And that’s a shame because the benefits of mindfulness and meditation are huge. Meditation reduces stress and anxiety. Meditation improves your quality of life and boost your immune system. Meditation has been shown to decrease anger and improve sleep, even among prison inmates. It can significantly reduce anxiety to just sit and breathe for as little as 10 minutes every day: There is an interesting and growing body of medical research that has discovered the positive health effects of religion and spirituality. The science doesn’t necessarily say that there is anything inherently healthy about religion, but it’s all the by-products that come from practicing religion that can make a big difference. For example, people with strong faith often release control of their struggles and worries to a higher power, which can help to relieve anxiety and stress. Religious groups also offer a strong source of community and friendships, which is critical for health and happiness. In many cases, the strength of friendships formed with fellow believers can last for decades, and those strong personal ties are crucial for long-term health. If you don’t consider yourself to be a religious person, then the lesson to takeaway from this body of research is that we all need a sense of belonging and community in our lives. It’s important to share your beliefs (whatever they happen to be about) with a community of people. People who have a community like that to lean on find themselves happier and healthier than those who lack that type of support. Community provides meaning in many people’s lives which according to Victor Frankl is the most important element for happiness. As a starting point, you can read studies on the religion-health connection here, here, and here. Expressing yourself creatively reduces the risk of disease and illness while simultaneously strengthening your health and wellness. For example, this study from the Harvard School of Public Health revealed that art helps to reduce stress and anxiety, increase positive emotions, and reduce the likelihood of depression, along with many other benefits. Another study, which was published in the Journal of Biobehavioral Medicine, discovered that creative writing improved the immune system response of HIV patients. For more ideas on why creating art is healthy, read this: The Health Benefits of Creativity. Every single one of us is incredibly creative, even if some people might have told us otherwise. It’s especially important to ignore the old “Left Brain, Right Brain” myth, stating that if you don’t use one side enough, you just aren’t creative: Exploring the world around you — whether that means traveling to faraway lands or hiking through the woods in your area — provides a wide range of mental and physical benefits. For starters, the benefits of sunlight (and the negative effects of artificial light) are well-documented in research. We know that not being outdoors enough significantly decreases our Vitamin D intake. We can easily avoid this, here is why: Additionally, researchers have begun to discover that wilderness excursions — known as “adventure therapy” — can promote weight loss, improve the self-esteem of people with mental illness, and evenreduce the rearrest rates of sex offenders. The central theme that runs through all of these studies is that exploring the outdoors and spending time in nature can increase the confidence you have in yourself and improve your ability to interact with others. On top of this, we also know that happiness is directly link to exercise. Contribution is an essential part of living a life that is happy, healthy, and meaningful. Too often we spend our lives consuming the world around us instead of creating it. We overdose on low quality information. We live sedentary lives and passively eat, watch, and soak up information rather than creating, contributing, and building our own things. As I wrote in this article… As you might expect, it’s dangerous to work too much. In Japan, the overtime and workplace stress has become so bad that they actually have a label for the people who die because of it: karoshi, which literally means “death by overwork.” Basically any way in which your job makes you feel stressed is bad for your health — unpredictable commutes, tension and disagreement with your boss or coworkers, feeling undervalued or unappreciated. Even working overtime increases the risk for coronary heart disease, independent of outside factors. What can you do about it? No one strategy will work for everyone, of course, but the principles in The Happiness Advantage by Shawn Achor offer a great place to start. Another crucial element to observe here is to fall in love with our body’s natural rhythm of working: The Ultradian Rhythm. Taking consistent breaks and not working for longer than ~90 minutes, can have a huge benefit for our health and feeling of happiness: Brian Wansink, a Cornell professor and author of Mindless Eating, has written that when people eat alone they are more likely to have a large binge feeding. Additionally, diets suffer when people eat alone. Lonely diners tend to eat fewer vegetables and less healthy meals. It seems that we make less of an effort to eat well when we are by ourselves than when someone else is involved. Given that an estimated one out of three people eat lunch at their desk, it’s easy to see how these little choices add up to big health problems over the long-term. Brene Brown is a researcher at the University of Houston and she has spent 10 years studying vulnerability. In recent years, her work has exploded with popularity as she delivered one of the most popular TED Talks of all-time and has written multiple best-selling books including Daring Greatlyand The Gifts of Imperfection. As Brown studied fear, uncertainty, and vulnerability, she discovered one key insight… If you allow your fear or vulnerability or shame to prevent you from showcasing your true self, then you will be preventing yourself from connecting fully with others. If you want to be able to move past fear, judgement, and uncertainty and into a healthier and happier life, then you have to give yourself permission first. You have to decide that you’re worthy. For much deeper and more useful discussion of vulnerability, I suggest reading Brown’s books:Daring Greatly and The Gifts of Imperfection. Living a healthy life is about much more than just diet and exercise. Don’t forget about the 10 areas above because they play a significant role in your health and happiness. As my friend Lissa Rankin often says, “What does your body need to heal?” In many cases it’s not a better diet or a new workout program, it’s one of these areas that might be impacting your health and happiness without you even realizing it.

      "    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.   There's an unfortunate reason why happiness is often elusive -- our brains simply aren't wired that way. Instead, our brains have evolved to survive, to protect ourselves, to keep us safe. Sure, we have moments of elation and periods of contentment and bliss. But many of us are plagued with persistent negative emotions -- we are just plain stuck in the \"blahs.\" How do we find more joy in our life? Like anything else, it takes practice to cultivate ongoing happiness. In a sense, we have to reset our baseline. It won't happen overnight, but here are the top 20 things you can do every day to discover the secrets of living a happier life. To find long-term happiness, you need to retrain your brain from a negative mindset to a positive mindset. Try these things: Spend one to two minutes looking for positives in your life. Do this three times a day for 45 days, and your brain will start doing it automatically. Choose a positive mantra for the day -- something you will repeat to yourself, such as \"Today is beautiful\" or \"I feel grateful for all I have.\" And when things go south, take a moment to try and see it from a positive light. Never underestimate the importance of recognizing the silver linings in life.

Take a moment to celebrate these small wins. Did you check off all the things on your to-do list that you've been procrastinating on? Yay! Did you finally clear out a thousand emails that have been filling up your inbox? Woohoo! Take pleasure in these little achievements. They add up! Related: 5 Ways to Celebrate Small Wins on Your Way to World Domination Work takes up a lot of our day, but it shouldn't be the only thing we do. It's important to pursue activities and interests beyond our job. Do you have a hobby? Are you spending time with friends and loved ones? Are you getting exercise? Creating balance in your life will reduce stress and give you other outlets to express yourself and have fun. Related: Work-Life Balance Is Simple. To Succeed at Work, Get a Life. Mindfulness mediation works by bringing your awareness and attention to the present moment. It's about being nonjudgmental and accepting how you are feeling. Practicing mindfulness means being present, aware and curious. Accepting what we are going through decreases stress and helps us see situations for what they are. Through mindfulness, we can find peace and affirmation in ourselves. Related: Mindfulness Isn't Just a Trend, It's Key to Being a Better Leader You may think of artists as being moody and depressed, but studies show that engaging in creative activities on a regular basis actually helps foster a happier mindset. Those who spend time using their imagination and being creative have more enthusiasm and are more likely to have feelings of long-term happiness and well-being. Such creative activities can include writing, painting, drawing and musical performance. Related: 14 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative Many of us strive for perfection -- we desire to push ourselves to be our best. But in order to be a truly happy person, you must embrace the imperfection that is part of daily life. Perfection is impossible, and holding ourselves and others to these standards is futile. We will always end up feeling let down. Accept that life is imperfect and recognize that there is beauty and grace in that imperfection. Related: Perfection Is the Greatest Obstacle to Productivity It's pretty hard to maintain overall happiness if you hate your job. Don't waste the best years of your life in a joyless job, even if it's paying the bills. What are you interested in? What are you truly passionate about? Focus on building a career in an area that motivates you and will provide you with a high level of satisfaction, and your happiness mindset will go up exponentially.

But the reality is, it's how you spend your money that helps you feel happier. The key is to do it wisely. Spending money on experiences -- travel, dining, concerts and so on -- can make us happier because we are sharing those experiences with others. Happiness connected to material possessions fades, but experiences help us define our purpose and passions in life. Related: How to Use Your Time Wisely by Prioritizing Your Goals Our thoughts and feelings often revolve around the past or the future. Reality is what you are experiencing in this very moment; what you are going through right now. Sometimes we want to escape that reality. But when we stay in the present, we are fully engaged in our lives. Endeavor to live in the moment, and you'll begin to have a deeper appreciation for your life.

Who are you, underneath it all? Search for ways to be comfortable in your own skin.

As humans, we have a fundamental need to interact and connect with others.

We're happier when we pursue happiness with others. Related: 25 Tips for Having Meaningful Relationships Stop comparing yourself to everyone around you.

But the truth is, you cannot experience joy or even contentment when you're consumed by worry.

How to find happiness: 6 methods 7 tips to help you achieve happiness Let yourself feel happy We all want to know how to find happiness. Whether you’re a recent college graduate or running a company, you’ve probably been looking for the answer to that question for a long time.  Unfortunately, sometimes your life’s responsibilities can keep you distracted from finding an answer. A demanding job, difficult coworkers, and confusion about your purpose in life are just a few examples of things that can get in the way. No matter how busy you are, though, you deserve to find happiness. Imagine how it would feel to wake up each day, calm and excited to take on your day. You’d love your job, be filled with a sense of purpose, and have plenty of time to spend with friends and family. No matter how happiness looks and feels to you, we’re here to help you find your way to it.  Let’s dive into the keys to being happy and how can you start finding happiness within yourself. Happiness is the feeling that washes over you when you experience positive emotions, interactions, or events. The brain responds to positive stimuli by releasing feel-good chemicals like dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins, sometimes known as happy hormones. Certain activities trigger your brain to release these hormones, like exercise, dancing, and meditation. But that boost of feel-good chemicals is situational, and it might go away when you stop that activity or leave a situation that makes you happy.  For example, runners typically experience a “high” after an intense run, resulting in a euphoric sensation that can last a few minutes to several hours. Similarly, taking risks stimulates the amygdala, a part of the brain that releases a combination of adrenaline and endorphins when it perceives that the body is in danger.  But that temporary rush of happy hormones doesn’t lead to a happier life. Life satisfaction is about more than exercise and taking risks. It’s about bettering yourself long-term, discovering what you’re good at, and protecting your energy. Healthy daily habits like eating a balanced diet and keeping a consistent sleep schedule are simple ways to improve your overall subjective well-being. But there are other factors that you have less control over, like your daily interactions, interpersonal relationships, and work-life balance, which are all subjective. The good news is there's always room to adjust your habits and foster a positive mental attitude to welcome more joy into your life.  Happiness doesn’t come from one place, particularly because people are so different. If you ask the people around you what makes them happy, you'll likely hear a lot of different answers.  One might respond that finding happiness means landing a prestigious job or getting a promotion. Another may define it as having lots of free time to spend on their hobbies. Someone else might argue that winning the lottery would make them the happiest person in the world.  But happiness goes beyond material goods. In fact, small day-to-day experiences and gestures are most likely to make you happy.  A study by researchers at the University of Massachusetts and Northwestern University tested out what makes people happy and how much material wealth impacts overall happiness.  They polled two very different participant groups: lottery winners and survivors of accidents. Each group was asked how much joy they received from everyday activities: a conversation with a friend or loved one, a good meal, and receiving a compliment. The lottery winners reported lower happiness levels than the survivors. The research suggests that rather than extreme material success, happiness appears in smaller, mundane moments — as long as you practice gratitude toward them. Although happiness can come from almost anywhere, focusing on the mundane joys you already experience can help you feel better.  If you’re experiencing a rough patch or emotional distress, happiness might seem far away, and that’s okay. Nobody can be happy all the time. In fact, according to the 2023 World Happiness Report, happiness levels in the U.S. are falling slightly every year. Many people associate happiness with achievements: switching careers, meeting a life partner, or making a big purchase. And it’s true that setting goals, working hard to make them happen, and successfully achieving them can contribute positively to your well-being. But happiness should be a side effect, not a goal.  One reason why it’s so hard to be happy is that happiness is a mindset, and it takes work to find. You might be looking for a one-size-fits-all answer, but living a happy life is more complex than that. Working to find the things that bring you joy — and incorporating them into your life — is the first step. There are no quick fixes to enjoying a stronger overall sense of satisfaction, but good habits can set you on the right path. Here are six ways to increase your happiness:  Chances are that many people depend on you: children, partners, parents, friends, and colleagues. This isn’t a bad thing, but it’s easy to become so distracted by taking care of others that you forget to take care of yourself.  Learn how to prioritize your physical and mental health and develop a self-care routine. Dedicating even a few small moments to yourself every day can give you space to breathe and improve your well-being.  Incorporate a few universal healthy choices into your daily life, like regular exercise, a nutritious diet, and sleep hygiene. But other habits can — and should — be subjective and unique to you. Explore what makes you feel like the best version of yourself.  Here are a few examples of habits and activities to try:  Try making time each day for extracurricular activities you enjoy. People who dedicate roughly two hours a day to free time activities experience higher overall well-being than people with less time for themselves. Two hours isn’t feasible for everyone, but even just a few minutes is a good place to start. Spend your free time on activities that you know are sources of happiness in your life. And if you aren’t sure what makes you happy yet, try new things. Making a new recipe, reading a book on a topic you like, and spending quality time with someone you love are all great options to start. Negative thoughts can affect your mood, both on a day-to-day basis and in the long term. If you find yourself ruminating over negative emotions or have a hard time letting go, try being more present. Mindfulness activities can help you live in the moment and appreciate the things you have rather than regret things you’ve done.  Mindfulness requires you to focus on what is immediately around you — sounds, smells, thoughts, and emotions — with curiosity and acceptance. Studies have found that people with higher levels of mindfulness also have higher levels of happiness and fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety.  You might feel happy or sad without understanding why, and learning the reasons behind your feelings can help you better control them. Starting a journaling practice is one way to get in touch with your emotions and learn more about your feelings, fears, and needs. There are several ways to journal with happiness in mind. Gratitude journaling is about reflecting on the things you’re grateful for, like the care of a partner or a smile from a stranger, while anxiety journaling can help you work through negative feelings and discover what makes you feel better.  One way to bring more joy to your life is to spread it to others. Generosity directly impacts happiness on a neural level, and altruism and acts of kindness can bring positive interpersonal relationships into your life.  When you give back to your community, you may develop a more sympathetic understanding of others, find purpose, and feel connected to the people around you. Try volunteering for an organization you care about or helping a friend with an issue they’ve been having. Their gratitude alone can make you happier. Goal-setting stimulates a personal growth mindset and gives you concrete steps to improving your overall well-being. Even small goals, like finishing a book or going for a walk every day, can give you a sense of accomplishment and encourage you to dream bigger for your own happiness. The way you approach goals is important, too. Mistakes happen, and approaching them with positivity rather than negative self-talk can improve your experience and better prepare you for the next try. We all have bad days at work and at home. Nobody’s immune to a difficult coworker, a disagreement with a family member, or disappointing news. But a positive mindset can help you push through even the cloudiest of days. That doesn’t mean you have to be happy all the time. It’s about moving forward with a positive attitude.  To send you on your way, here are seven final tips to help you live a life with more joy:  Celebrate: Recognize your achievements with pride, even ones that seem small.  Rest: Prioritize good sleep and regular rest for your body to wake up feeling refreshed and ready to get to your day. Declutter: Analyze your life and avoid or adjust the things that don’t make you happy. This could be anything from redecorating your office space or ending relationships with toxic people.  Maintain your values: Pay attention to your worldview and personal values, and let them guide your behavior. Smile: Allow yourself to be carefree and find humor in everything, even when you make mistakes. Take control: Being happy is about you. Learn how to find it within yourself, not through external validation. Share: Surround yourself with positive influences and people who share your joy. Happiness is hard to find, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Everyone deserves to find happiness and cultivate a positive mindset that helps them enjoy the good and push through the bad.  Start by identifying the things you love and finding ways to work through the things you don’t. It might take work to adjust your priorities, especially when life gets busy. But living a happier life is worth it — and your joy will influence the people around you, too.  Make meaningful changes and become the best version of yourself. BetterUp's professional Coaches are here to support your personal growth journey.

      "Happiness - it’s something we all aim for, along with health, wealth, and success in our endeavours. However, finding happiness in everyday life can be a difficult task. As a much sought-after emotional state, happiness can appear briefly, or be influenced by many other issues in our work and lives, making it difficult to find. In this guide, Calmer’s Founder, Tania Diggory, explores what happiness is, how to find happiness within yourself, and the simple steps you can try to feel happier on a regular basis. Happiness is the mental state of experiencing positive or pleasant emotions.  In my experience, many people define happiness as the feeling of intense joy, which may make it harder to feel like we’re happy in our everyday lives. In fact, there are many levels to happiness, starting from a sense of contentment, and ranging through to exhilarating jubilation. Many of us set off on a quest to reach exhilarating happiness highs on a regular basis, and this often ends in disappointment. Instead of happiness, try focusing on contentment. Contentment is the mental state of experiencing satisfaction in your present state. It is often felt when practicing mindfulness, or feeling comfortable in your mind, body, and surroundings. While we all experience a range of emotions each day, it can be helpful to practice finding contentment on a regular basis. Next time you take a tea break, or sit back after completing a piece of work, give yourself a minute or two to practice feeling good in your body, mind, and with your daily accomplishments. Now that I’ve introduced you to the concept of contentment, here’s six steps I tend to recommend to anyone looking to feel more positive in their daily life. Reframing how you view happiness, and where you get your happiness, can be simple changes that really make a difference. Here’s my six-step process to feeling happier in your life and your work:  Many people connect happiness to the achievement of certain goals or aspirations. This practice makes happiness a reward, rather than an emotion that is deserved to be felt on a day-to-day basis. Instead of chasing goals, and as an extension, chasing happiness, allow yourself to feel happiness whenever it comes your way.  Following on from point 1, the second downside to pinning happiness on external goals is that you may fall into unhelpful thinking habits. By placing your happiness onto something external, you may forget that feeling happy is something that comes from inside, and can be found by looking inward, rather than waiting for an external action to trigger it. Try reframing how you approach happiness, and instead of making it a long-awaited goal, consider what makes you happy on a regular basis. That may be time with family, friends, or a loved one, or doing a certain activity, such as painting, cycling, or cooking. Give yourself permission to schedule these moments of happiness into your life on a regular basis.  The third step is to practice looking inwards, with a view to discover happiness from within you. This is an activity that takes time and effort, but makes for a worthwhile habit. Start to regularly check-in with yourself, and identify how you feel. If you’re stressed, try implementing a stress-management strategy, or if you’re feeling like you could take better care of yourself, try setting up a self-care plan.  And if you need support in checking-in with your mental health and wellbeing, try joining the Calmer Community, our membership platform providing a range of activities and practices to do each month.  Once you’ve started checking-in with yourself, you can also begin to address any areas that may be troubling you. Often, internal problems can reduce self-esteem, so it may be worth spending some time looking after yourself. The NHS notes that focusing on self-esteem can make you happy, saying “The best way to improve your self-esteem is to treat yourself as you'd treat a valued friend, in a positive but honest way.” This is a great way to review how you look after yourself, especially if you also work for yourself. Thinking of yourself as your best boss, or your best friend, can help you to re-frame how you treat yourself and enable you to treat yourself in a kinder, fairer way. And on top of that, allow yourself to be vulnerable, even at work. Noting your problem areas, or your weaknesses, is an important first step in finding support for them or overcoming your issues altogether.  Similar to practicing looking inwards, taking time to be present across your day will enable you to truly take in your surroundings, and connect with your emotions on a deeper level. Practicing mindfulness at work is becoming a new strategy that businesses like Google and Facebook are encouraging their staff to do, so you may wish to try this in your role, or with your team. Being present may also enable you to experience happiness on a more regular basis, and on a deeper level.  The final step on my six-step process is to take time in appreciating yourself. Appreciate your work, your life, and your accomplishments. You can find happiness by simply reflecting on past happenings, some of them achievements, and others simply pleasant experiences.  If you’re a freelancer or entrepreneur, try reflecting on your journey on a regular basis. It’s easy to get swept up with future plans, and forget how well you’ve done previously. By focusing on your past experiences, you’ll not only re-experience the emotions that certain milestones brought, but also find ways to improve yourself and your business too. I hope that this guide has provided you with the simple steps to finding happiness on a more regular basis. If there’s only one thing you take away from this post, it’s to recognise that you have the power to feel happy within you, and with practice, it can be felt more frequently. As one of the UK’s leading mental health and wellbeing organisations supporting professionals and entrepreneurs, Calmer believes a happy mind makes for a happy business.

Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. happiness,  in psychology, a state of emotional well-being that a person experiences either in a narrow sense, when good things happen in a specific moment, or more broadly, as a positive evaluation of one’s life and accomplishments overall—that is, subjective well-being. Happiness can be distinguished both from negative emotions (such as sadness, fear, and anger) and also from other positive emotions (such as affection, excitement, and interest). This emotion often co-occurs with a specific facial expression: the smile. People from around the world tend to have a similar concept of happiness and can recognize happiness in others. As a result, the specific emotion of happiness is often included as one of a small number of basic emotions that cannot be broken down into more fundamental emotions and that may combine to form other, more complex emotions (in fact, it is sometimes the only positive emotion that is considered to be basic). Thus, happiness is an important concept for researchers who study emotions. An entire field of research has developed around the more inclusive concept of subjective well-being, which is characterized by a broad collection of happiness-related phenomena rather than a specific momentary emotion. As one might expect, people who are happy in this way tend to experience frequent positive emotions and infrequent negative emotions. This broader form of happiness is not purely emotional, however: it also has a cognitive component. When happy people are asked to think back on the conditions and events in their lives, they tend to evaluate these conditions and events positively. Thus, happy people report being satisfied with their lives and the various domains in their lives. Interestingly, these different components of happiness do not always co-occur within the same person. It is possible that someone could experience a great deal of negative emotions yet still acknowledge that the conditions of his or her life are good ones. For example, someone who works with the poor, the sick, or the destitute may experience frequent negative emotions but may also feel satisfied with life because the work is worthwhile. Similarly, people who spend lots of time engaging in hedonistic pleasures may experience frequent momentary positive emotions, but they may also feel that life is empty and meaningless. Subjective well-being researchers are interested in the various factors that influence these distinct components. Psychologists are interested in happiness for two reasons. First, psychologists study happiness because laypeople are interested in happiness. When people from around the world are asked to list the things that are most important to them, happiness consistently tops the list. People rank attaining happiness as being more important than acquiring money, maintaining good health, and even going to heaven. Psychologists believe that they can help people achieve this goal of being happy by studying the factors that are associated with happiness. A second reason why psychologists study happiness is because a person’s evaluative responses to the world may provide information about the basic characteristics of human nature. One of the most basic principles guiding psychological theory is that people and animals are motivated to approach things in the world that cause pleasure and to avoid things in the world that cause pain. Presumably, this behavior results from adaptive mechanisms that guide organisms toward resources and away from dangers. If so, the evaluative reactions of many people about the world should be useful and revealing. For instance, some psychologists have suggested that human beings have a basic need to experience strong and supportive social relationships. They point to evidence from the field of subjective well-being to support their claim—a person’s social relationships are reliably linked to his or her happiness. Thus, cataloging the correlates of happiness should provide important information about the features of human nature. The results of scientific studies reveal several trends. For instance, when researchers ask people to report on their happiness, their answers tend to be consistent over time: people who say they are happy now also tend to say that they are happy when asked again in the future. Because the conditions in people’s lives don’t usually change that frequently, the stability of happiness measures provides support for the idea that these measures truly do tap this important construct. In addition, research shows that when life events do occur, people’s reports of happiness change in response. Perhaps more importantly, when psychologists try to assess happiness in a variety of different ways, these measures all seem to converge on the same answer. For instance, when researchers ask people to provide self-reports of happiness, they tend to agree with informant-reports of happiness—that is, ratings provided by friends and acquaintances. Furthermore, psychological tests—such as those that ask subjects to list as many positive memories as they can within a minute—may also determine who is happy without even asking for an explicit judgment of happiness, and, again, these measures tend to agree with self-reports. Psychologists can even find evidence of happiness in the brain: certain patterns of brain activity are reliably associated with happiness. When psychologists track people’s levels of happiness, most people report being in mildly positive moods most of the time. In addition, when psychologists ask people to rate their overall life satisfaction, most people report scores that are above neutral. This research finding is not limited to relatively well-off samples (like the college students who are often asked to participate in psychological studies). Instead, it has been replicated in many different populations in many nations around the world. Thus, when psychologists study the correlates of happiness, they are usually looking for factors that distinguish the very happy from the mildly happy rather than the happy from the miserable. Psychologists have arrived at several surprising conclusions in their search for predictors of happiness. Many of the factors that may first come to mind do not seem to play a major role in happiness. For example, although people strive to acquire high-paying jobs and dream about winning the lottery, income is not strongly correlated with happiness. Wealthy people are happier than poorer people, but the difference is not very large. As one might expect, the association between money and happiness is strongest among very poor groups and among poor countries. Income leads to smaller and smaller gains in happiness as income levels rise. Health also plays a role in subjective well-being, but the associations are, again, surprisingly small. Surveys of representative populations show that objective measures (including doctors’ reports, hospital visits, and lists of symptoms) are very weakly correlated with happiness. Subjective reports (such as a person’s own evaluation of his or her health) tend to correlate more strongly, but even these associations are, at most, moderate in size. In addition, although people with major health problems, such as paralyzing spinal-cord injuries, are quite a bit less happy than uninjured people, the difference is not as large as some might expect. Even people with very serious illnesses tend to report happiness scores that are above neutral. The factor that has been most closely linked to high levels of happiness is social relationships. Research consistently shows that people who have strong social relationships tend to report higher levels of well-being. As with other domains, subjective reports of relationship quality and relationship satisfaction tend to exhibit the highest correlations with subjective well-being. But even more objective measures, including the number of close friends a person has, the number of social organizations to which the person belongs, and the amount of time the person spends with others, all show small to moderate correlations with happiness. As one might expect based on this research, specific types of social relationships are also important for subjective well-being. For instance, marital status is one of the strongest demographic predictors of happiness. Married people consistently report higher levels of happiness than single people, who report greater happiness than the widowed, divorced, or separated. Interestingly, however, it does not appear that marriage itself causes higher levels of subjective well-being. Longitudinal studies show that people only receive a small boost in happiness around the time they get married, and they quickly adapt to baseline levels. The differences between married and unmarried people are due primarily to the lasting negative effects of divorce and widowhood, along with selection effects that might actually predispose happy people to marry. Other demographic characteristics also show weak associations with happiness. Religious people tend to report greater happiness than nonreligious people, though the size of these effects varies depending on whether religious beliefs or religious behaviors are measured. Factors such as intelligence, education, and job prestige are also only slightly related to well-being. Happiness does not seem to change dramatically over the course of the life span, except perhaps at the very end of the life when declines are somewhat steep. In addition, sex differences in subjective well-being are not large. In contrast to the relatively weak effects of external circumstance, research shows that internal factors play a strong role in subjective well-being. Individual differences in happiness-related variables emerge early in life, are stable over time, and are at least partially heritable. For instance, behavioral genetic studies show that identical twins who were reared apart are quite a bit more similar in their levels of happiness than are fraternal twins who were reared apart. This suggests that genes play an important role. Most estimates put the heritability of subjective well-being components at around 40–50 percent for positive emotional states and between 30–40 percent with respect to the negative emotional states of depression and anxiety. Personality researchers have shown that at least some of these genetic effects may be due to the influence of specific personality traits on happiness. For example, the stable personality trait of extraversion is moderately correlated with positive affect (that is, the feeling of a positive emotion) and, to a lesser extent, with life satisfaction and negative affect (that is, the feeling of a negative emotion). People who are outgoing, assertive, and sociable tend to report more intense and more frequent positive emotions. This association is so robust that some psychologists have even suggested that the two constructs—extraversion and positive affect—are controlled by the same underlying physiological systems. Similarly, researchers have shown that the basic personality trait of neuroticism is moderately to strongly correlated with negative affect (and again, to a lesser extent, with life satisfaction and positive affect). This and other research on the links between happiness and traits (including factors such as optimism and self-esteem) show that personality plays a strong role in people’s subjective well-being. There is a popular notion that the way that people view the world should influence their happiness. Some people always look for the silver lining in things, and presumably this positive outlook shapes the emotions that they feel. Psychologists, too, believe that the way that one thinks about the world is related to characteristic levels of happiness. A great deal of research has been conducted to examine the cognitive processes that affect a person’s subjective well-being. For instance, many researchers examine the role that social comparison processes play in happiness. Initially, psychologists thought that people evaluated the conditions in their own lives by comparing them with the conditions in other people’s lives. Those individuals who are worse off than the people around them (in other words, people who experience upward comparisons) should experience unhappiness; those individuals who are better off than the people around them (in other words, people who experience downward comparisons) would experience happiness. Although this effect can occur, other research suggests that the processes are a bit more complicated. For one thing, both upward and downward comparisons can lead to either increases or decreases in happiness. People may look to someone who is better off and think either that they are performing terribly in comparison or that the other person serves as an example of an achievement toward which they can strive. Obviously, these two interpretations should lead to different effects on happiness. In addition, research shows that happy and unhappy people often choose different people for comparison. Happy people may choose comparison people who serve to maintain their happiness; unhappy people may choose comparisons that lead to less happiness. Thus, social comparison affects happiness in complicated ways. Psychologists have also shown that goals and aspirations influence happiness. Not surprisingly, people who are rapidly approaching a goal tend to experience higher levels of happiness than people who are approaching a goal more slowly. But research also shows that simply having important goals is associated with greater happiness. Presumably, the sense of purpose that these goals create may protect people from the negative effects of temporary setbacks. Interestingly, the specific goals that people choose may also affect their happiness. Research suggests that choosing goals that are a challenge but not unachievable is important. Although people tend to think about happiness as an outcome that they desire rather than as a tool that can be used to achieve additional goals, psychologists have begun to ask what function happiness serves. One of the best known theories, developed by American psychologist Barbara Fredrickson in 1998, posits that the function of happiness (or more precisely, the function of positive emotions) is to broaden one’s thinking and to build one’s resources. According to this theory, positive emotions lead people to think creatively and to try new things. As a result, happy people can develop new ways to approach the world, new interests, new social relationships, and even new physical skills. All of these effects lead to positive outcomes in people’s lives. Psychologists have begun using experimental and longitudinal studies to determine whether positive affect plays a role in future positive outcomes. These studies provide evidence that happy people are more sociable and cooperative than unhappy people, are healthier than unhappy people, and earn more money than unhappy people. A number of studies have even shown that happy people live longer than unhappy people (and this is not just due to the fact that happy people tend to be healthy). Thus, although most people want to be happy because it feels good, this desired goal may lead to other positive outcomes in their lives.\n"

      " Happiness is a positive and pleasant emotion, ranging from contentment to intense joy. Moments of happiness may be triggered by positive life experiences or thoughts, but sometimes it may arise from no obvious cause. The level of happiness for longer periods of time is more strongly correlated with levels of life satisfaction, subjective well-being, flourishing and eudaimonia. In common usage, the word happy can be an appraisal of those measures themselves or as a shorthand for a \"source\" of happiness (for example, \"find happiness in life\" as in finding the meaning in life). As with any emotion, the precise definition of happiness has been a perennial debate in philosophy.\n",
      " \"Happiness\" is subject to debate on usage and meaning,[1][2][3][4][5] and on possible differences in understanding by culture.[6][7]\n",
      " The word is mostly used in relation to two factors:[8]\n",
      " Some usages can include both of these factors. Subjective well-being (swb)[b] includes measures of current experience (emotions, moods, and feelings) and of life satisfaction.[c] For instance Sonja Lyubomirsky has described happiness as \"the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one's life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.\"[24] Eudaimonia,[25] is a Greek term variously translated as happiness, welfare, flourishing, and blessedness. Xavier Landes[14] has proposed that happiness include measures of subjective wellbeing, mood and eudaimonia.[15]\n",
      " These differing uses can give different results.[26] Whereas Nordic countries often score highest on swb surveys, South American countries score higher on affect-based surveys of current positive life experiencing.[27]\n",
      " The implied meaning of the word may vary depending on context,[28] qualifying happiness as a polyseme and a fuzzy concept.\n",
      " A further issue is when measurement is made; appraisal of a level of happiness at the time of the experience may be different from appraisal via memory at a later date.[29][30]\n",
      " Some users accept these issues, but continue to use the word because of its convening power.[31]\n",
      " German philosophy professor Michela Summa says that the distinction between joy and happiness is that \"joy accompanies the process through and through, whereas happiness seems to be more strictly tied to the moment of achievement of the process... joy is not only a direct emotional response to an event that is embedded in our life-concerns but is also tightly bound to the present moment, whereas happiness presupposes an evaluative stance concerning one period of one's life or one's own life as a whole.\"[32]\n",
      " People have been trying to measure happiness for centuries. In 1780, the English utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham proposed that as happiness was the primary goal of humans it should be measured as a way of determining how well the government was performing.[33]\n",
      " Today, happiness is typically measured using self-report surveys. Self-reporting is prone to cognitive biases and other sources of errors, such as peak–end rule. Studies show that memories of felt emotions can be inaccurate.[34] Affective forecasting research shows that people are poor predictors of their future emotions, including how happy they will be.[35]\n",
      " Happiness economists are not overly concerned with philosophical and methodological issues and continue to use questionaries to measure average happiness of populations.\n",
      " Several scales have been developed to measure happiness:\n",
      " Since 2012, a World Happiness Report has been published. Happiness is evaluated, as in \"How happy are you with your life as a whole?\", and in emotional reports, as in \"How happy are you now?,\" and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts. Using these measures, the report identifies the countries with the highest levels of happiness. In subjective well-being measures, the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports.[46]\n",
      " The UK began to measure national well-being in 2012,[47] following Bhutan, which had already been measuring gross national happiness.[48][49]\n",
      " Academic economists and international economic organizations are arguing for and developing multi-dimensional dashboards which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human wellbeing. There are many different contributors to adult wellbeing, such as the point that happiness judgements partly reflect the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course.[50] Although these factors play a role in happiness, they do not all need to improve simultaneously to help one achieve an increase in happiness.\n",
      " Happiness has been found to be quite stable over time.[51][52]\n",
      " As of 2016[update], no evidence of happiness causing improved physical health has been found; the topic is being researched at the Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.[53]\n",
      "A positive relationship has been suggested between the volume of the brain's gray matter in the right precuneus area and one's subjective happiness score.[54]\n",
      " Sonja Lyubomirsky has estimated that 50 percent of a given human's happiness level could be genetically determined, 10 percent is affected by life circumstances and situation, and a remaining 40 percent of happiness is subject to self-control.[55][56]\n",
      " When discussing genetics and their effects on individuals it is important to first understand that genetics do not predict behavior. It is possible for genes to increase the likelihood of individuals being happier compared to others, but they do not 100 percent predict behavior.\n",
      " At this point in scientific research, it has been hard to find a lot of evidence to support this idea that happiness is affected in some way by genetics. In a 2016 study, Michael Minkov and Michael Harris Bond found that a gene by the name of SLC6A4 was not a good predictor of happiness level in humans.[57]\n",
      " On the other hand, there have been many studies that have found genetics to be a key part in predicting and understanding happiness in humans.[58] In a review article discussing many studies on genetics and happiness, they discussed the common findings.[59] The author found an important factor that has affected scientist findings this being how happiness is measured. For example, in certain studies when subjective wellbeing is measured as a trait heredity is found to be higher, about 70 to 90 percent. In another study, 11,500 unrelated genotypes were studied, and the conclusion was the heritability was only 12 to 18 percent. Overall, this article found the common percent of heredity was about 20 to 50 percent.[60]\n",
      " Theories on how to achieve happiness include \"encountering unexpected positive events\",[61] \"seeing a significant other\",[62] and \"basking in the acceptance and praise of others\".[63]\n",
      "Some others believe that happiness is not solely derived from external, momentary pleasures.[64]\n",
      " Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes, and Seligmann covers a broad range of levels and topics, including \"the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life.\"[65] The psychiatrist George Vaillant and the director of longitudinal Study of Adult Development at Harvard University Robert J. Waldinger found that those who were happiest and healthier reported strong interpersonal relationships.[66] Research showed that adequate sleep contributes to well-being.[67] Good mental health and good relationships contribute more to happiness than income does.[68] In 2018, Laurie R. Santos course titled \"Psychology and the Good Life\" became the most popular course in the history of Yale University and was made available for free online to non-Yale students.[69]\n",
      " Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.[70] Kahneman has said that \"\"When you look at what people want for themselves, how they pursue their goals, they seem more driven by the search for satisfaction than the search for happiness.\"[71]\n",
      " Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist and prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II, noticed that those who lost hope soon died, while those who held to meaning and purpose tended to live on. Frankl observed that joy and misery had more to do with a person's perspective and choice than with their surroundings. Three key sources of meaning that he highlights in his writings include the following:[72]\n",
      " Psychologist Robert Emmons has identified the centrality of goals in pursuing happiness. He found that when humans pursue meaningful projects and activities without primarily focusing on happiness, happiness often results as a by-product. Indicators of meaningfulness predict positive effects on life, while lack of meaning predicts negative states such as psychological distress. Emmons summarizes the four categories of meaning which have appeared throughout various studies. He proposes to call them WIST, or work, intimacy, spirituality, and transcendence.[73]\n",
      " Throughout life, one's views of happiness and what brings happiness can evolve. In early and emerging adulthood many people focus on seeking happiness through friends, objects, and money. Middle aged-adults generally transition from searching for object-based happiness to looking for happiness in money and relationships. In older adulthood, people tend to focus more on personal peace and lasting relationships (ex. children, spouse, grandchildren).[74]  Antti Kauppinen, a Swedish philosopher and phenomenological researcher, posited that the perception of time affects the change in focus throughout life. In early adulthood, most view life optimistically, looking to the future and seeing an entire life ahead of them. Those that fall into the middle life, see that life has passed behind them as well as seeing more life ahead. Those in older adulthood often see their lives as behind them. This shift in perspective causes a shift in the pursuit of happiness from more tactile, object based happiness, to social and relational based happiness.[75]\n",
      " Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a pyramid depicting the levels of human needs, psychological, and physical. When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, self-actualization is reached.[76] Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mihály Csíkszentmihályi.[77] The concept of flow is the idea that after our basic needs are met we can achieve greater happiness by altering our consciousness by becoming so engaged in a task that we lose our sense of time. Our intense focus causes us to forget any other issues, which in return promotes positive emotions.[78]\n",
      " Erich Fromm said \"Happiness is the indication that man has found the answer to the problem of human existence: the productive realization of his potentialities and thus, simultaneously, being one with the world and preserving the integrity of his self. In spending his energy productively he increases his powers, he „burns without being consumed.\"\"[79]\n",
      " Self-determination theory relates intrinsic motivation to three needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness.[80] Competence refers to an individual's ability to be effective in their interactions with the environment, autonomy refers to a person's flexibility in choice and decision making, and relatedness is the need to establish warm, close personal relationships.[81]\n",
      " Ronald Inglehart has traced cross-national differences in the level of happiness based on data from the World Values Survey.[82] He finds that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness. When basic needs are satisfied, the degree of happiness depends on economic and cultural factors that enable free choice in how people live their lives. Happiness also depends on religion in countries where free choice is constrained.[83]\n",
      " Sigmund Freud said that all humans strive after happiness, but that the possibilities of achieving it are restricted because we \"are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from the state of things.\"[84]\n",
      " The idea of motivational hedonism is the theory that pleasure is the aim for human life.[85]\n",
      " Since 2000 the field of positive psychology, which focuses on the study of happiness and human flourishing rather than maladjusted behavior or illness, expanded drastically in terms of scientific publications. It has produced many different views on causes of happiness, and on factors that correlate with happiness, such as positive social interactions with family and friends.[86]\n",
      " These factors include six key virtues:\n",
      " 1. Wisdom and knowledge, which includes creativity, curiosity, love of learning and open-mindedness.\n",
      " 2. Courage, which includes bravery, persistence, integrity, and vitality.\n",
      " 3. Humanity, which includes love, kindness, and social intelligence.\n",
      " 4. Justice, which includes leadership, fairness, and loyalty.\n",

      " In order for a virtue to be considered a key strength in the field of positive psychology it must meet the demands of 12 criteria, namely ubiquity (cross-cultural), fulfilling, morally valued, does not diminish others, be a nonfelicitous opposite (have a clear antonym that is negative), traitlike, measurable, distinct, have paragons (distinctly show up in individuals' behaviors), have prodigies (show up in youth), be selectively absent (distinctly does not show up in some individuals), and is supported by some institutions.[88][89]\n",
      " Numerous short-term self-help interventions have been developed and demonstrated to improve happiness.[90][91]\n",
      " A person's level of subjective well-being is determined by many different factors and social influences prove to be a strong one. Results from the famous Framingham Heart Study indicate that friends three degrees of separation away (that is, friends of friends of friends) can affect a person's happiness. From abstract: \"A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25%.\"[92]\n",
      " Various writers, including Camus and Tolle, have written that the act of searching or seeking for happiness is incompatible with being happy.[93][94][95][96]\n",
      " John Stuart Mill believed that for the great majority of people happiness is best achieved en passant, rather than striving for it directly. This meant no self-consciousness, scrutiny, self-interrogation, dwelling on, thinking about, imagining or questioning on one's happiness. Then, if otherwise fortunately circumstanced, one would \"inhale happiness with the air you breathe.\"[d]\n",
      " William Inge said that \"on the whole, the happiest people seem to be those who have no particular cause for being happy except the fact that they are so.\"[99] Orison Swett Marden said that \"some people are born happy.\"[e]\n",
      " Cognitive behavioral therapy is a popular therapeutic method used to change habits by changing thoughts and problematic behaviors. It focuses on emotional regulation and uses a lot of positive psychology practices. It is often used for people with depression, anxiety, or addictions and works towards how to lead a happier life.[101] Common processes in cognitive behavioral therapy are reframing thoughts from problematic thinking patterns by replacing them with beneficial or supportive ones, roleplaying, finding beneficial coping skills, and choosing new activities that support desired behaviors and avoid negative behaviors.[102]\n",
      " Coined by Harvard professor of psychology and author of \"Stumbling on Happiness\", Daniel Gilbert, synthetic happiness is the happiness we make for ourselves. In his TedTalk titled, the surprising science of happiness, Gilbert explains that everyone possesses a \"psychological immune system\" that helps to regulate our emotional reactions.[103] Through research that he studied and held, he and his team found that personal happiness is largely based on personal perception. Synthetic happiness as an idea has become more popular as people attempt to define happiness as a journey instead of a destination.[citation needed]\n",
      " Happiness research understands \"happiness\" as \"life satisfaction\" or \"well-being\". Since it has proved difficult to find a definition of happiness, individual people are instead asked how happy they feel.[104] Numerous surveys are then summarized and analyzed using static methods. Although some researchers believe that the scales are fundamentally unsuitable for estimating happiness,[105] other researchers argue that the happiness indices formed on the basis of the survey have a high statistical correspondence with characteristics that are generally understood to indicate a happy person. For example, individuals who report high happiness on scales smile more often, exhibit more social behavior, are more helpful, and are less likely to commit suicide. For this reason, happiness indices determined on the basis of the survey are considered reliable by happiness researchers.[106]\n",
      " Before recommending strategies, it is crucial to rely on rigorous, large-scale experiments that confirm their effectiveness. Over the past decade, there has been a significant shift in what constitutes 'high-quality evidence' in psychology (there were adopted e. g. practices like pre-registration, committing to specific methodological and analytical decisions in advance, and increased sample sizes to avoid underpowered studies). A meta analysis of 2023 has used this modern evidence-based approach, evaluating evidence for common happiness-boosting strategies. The study aimed to shed light on the effectiveness of these strategies and their impact on subjective well-being. As a first step, the authors analyzed numerous media articles on happiness to identify the five most commonly recommended strategies, these were: expressing gratitude, enhancing sociability, exercising, practicing mindfulness/meditation, and increasing exposure to nature. Next, the  published scientific literature was searched but limited to the above-described high-quality criteria that tested the effects of these strategies on subjective well-being in everyday individuals (non-clinical samples). Only 10% of the initially retrieved studies met those rigorous criteria. The findings revealed that unlike so far suggested by scientific studies, there is currently still a lack of robust scientific evidence to support some of the most frequently suggested happiness strategies. Among the five most common happiness strategies, there was \"reasonably solid evidence\" of positive effects from a) Gratitude messages or lists, b) conversations with strangers or  Gratitude and sociability - that is, establishing and maintaining social relationships. In contrast, no convincing evidence could be found that c) sports, d) mindfulness training, or e) walks in the countryside make people happier.[107]\n",
      " There is a wealth of cross-sectional studies on happiness and physical health that shows consistent positive relationships.[108] Follow-up studies appear to show that happiness does not predict longevity in sick populations, but that it does predict longevity among healthy populations.[109]\n",
      " Other positive effects of happiness and being in a good mood, that have been studied and confirmed, are that happier people tend to be more helpful, attentive, and generous to others,[110] as well as to themselves.[111] Happy people also have been shown to act more cooperatively and less aggressively,[112] and be more likely to help others in need.[113] They were also found to be more sociable and communicative.[114]\n",
      " More positive effects that happiness seems to evoke are creative problem solving,[115] persisting through challenges,[116] more intrinsic motivation for work related or responsible tasks,[117] and being more effective at using efficient decision-making strategies.[118]\n",
      " While some believe that success breeds happiness, Lyubomirsky, King and Diener found that happiness precedes success in income, relationships, marriages, work performance, and health.[119]\n",
      " Low mood is correlated with many negative life outcomes such as suicide, poor health, substance abuse, and low life expectancy. By extension, happiness protects from those negative outcomes.\n",
      " June Gruber argued that happiness may trigger a person to be more sensitive, more gullible, less successful, and more likely to undertake high risk behaviours.[120][121] She also conducted studies suggesting that seeking happiness can have negative effects, such as failure to meet over-high expectations.[122][123][124] Iris Mauss has shown that the more people strive for happiness, the more likely they will set up too high of standards and feel disappointed.[125][126]  One study shows that women who value happiness more tend to react less positively to happy emotions.[127] A 2012 study found that psychological well-being was higher for people who experienced both positive and negative emotions.[128][129]\n",
      " Jeremy Bentham believed that public policy should attempt to maximize happiness, and he even attempted to estimate a \"hedonic calculus\". Thomas Jefferson put the \"pursuit of happiness\" on the same level as life and liberty in the United States Declaration of Independence. Presently, many countries and organizations regularly measure population happiness through large-scale surveys, e.g., Bhutan.\n",
      " Richer nations tend to have higher measures of happiness than poorer nations.[130][131] The relationship between wealth and happiness is not linear and the same GDP increase in poor countries will have more effect on happiness than in wealthy countries.[132][133][134][135]\n",
      " Some political scientists argue that life satisfaction is positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net, pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions.[136][137][138] Others argue that happiness is strongly correlated with economic freedom,[139] preferably within the context of a western mixed economy, with free press and a democracy.\n",
      " Personal happiness can be affected by cultural factors.[140][141][142] Hedonism appears to be more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic cultures.[143] Forcing people to marry and stay married can have adverse consequences. Research has shown that unhappily married couples suffer 3–25 times the risk of developing clinical depression.[144][145][146]\n",
      " One theory is that higher SWB in richer countries is related to their more individualistic cultures. Individualistic cultures may satisfy intrinsic motivations to a higher degree that collectivistic cultures, and fulfilling intrinsic motivations, as opposed to extrinsic motivations, may relate to greater levels of happiness, leading to more happiness in individualistic cultures.[147]\n",
      " Cultural views on happiness have changed over time.[148] For instance Western concern about childhood being a time of happiness has occurred only since the 19th century.[149] Not all cultures seek to maximize happiness,[150][nb 1][nb 2] and some cultures are averse to happiness.[151][152] It has been found in Western cultures that individual happiness is the most important. Some other cultures have opposite views and tend to be aversive to the idea of individual happiness. For example, people living in Eastern Asian cultures focus more on the need for happiness within relationships with others and even find personal happiness to be harmful to fulfilling happy social relationships.[151][150][153][nb 1][nb 2]\n",
      " People in countries with high cultural religiosity tend to relate their life satisfaction less to their emotional experiences than people in more secular countries.[154]\n",
      " Happiness forms a central theme of Buddhist teachings.[155] For ultimate freedom from suffering, the Noble Eightfold Path leads its practitioner to Nirvana, a state of everlasting peace. Ultimate happiness is only achieved by overcoming craving in all forms. More mundane forms of happiness, such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships, are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people (see sukha). Buddhism also encourages the generation of loving kindness and compassion, the desire for the happiness and welfare of all beings.[156][157][158][unreliable source?][unreliable source?]\n",
      " In Advaita Vedanta, the ultimate goal of life is happiness, in the sense that duality between Atman and Brahman is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the Self in all.\n",
      " Patanjali, author of the Yoga Sutras, wrote quite exhaustively on the psychological and ontological roots of bliss.[159]\n",
      " The Chinese Confucian thinker Mencius, who had sought to give advice to ruthless political leaders during China's Warring States period, was convinced that the mind played a mediating role between the \"lesser self\" (the physiological self) and the \"greater self\" (the moral self), and that getting the priorities right between these two would lead to sage-hood.[160] He argued that if one did not feel satisfaction or pleasure in nourishing one's \"vital force\" with \"righteous deeds\", then that force would shrivel up (Mencius, 6A:15 2A:2). More specifically, he mentions the experience of intoxicating joy if one celebrates the practice of the great virtues, especially through music.[161]\n",
      " Happiness or simcha (Hebrew: שמחה) in Judaism is considered an important element in the service of God.[162] The biblical verse \"worship The Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs,\" (Psalm 100:2) stresses joy in the service of God.[163] A popular teaching by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, a 19th-century Chassidic Rabbi, is \"Mitzvah Gedolah Le'hiyot Besimcha Tamid,\" it is a great mitzvah (commandment) to always be in a state of happiness. When a person is happy they are much more capable of serving God and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset.[164][self-published source?]\n",
      " The primary meaning of \"happiness\" in various European languages involves good fortune, blessing, or a similar happening. The meaning in Greek philosophy refers primarily to ethics.\n",
      " In Christianity, the ultimate end of human existence consists in felicity, Latin equivalent to the Greek eudaimonia (\"blessed happiness\"), described by the 13th-century philosopher-theologian Thomas Aquinas as a beatific vision of God's essence in the next life.[165]\n",
      " According to Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, man's last end is happiness: \"all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness.\"[166] Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that happiness cannot be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts, but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts, such as habits according to virtue.[167]\n",
      " According to Aquinas, happiness consists in an \"operation of the speculative intellect\": \"Consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation, viz. in the contemplation of Divine things.\" And, \"the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the practical intellect.\" So: \"Therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life to come, consists entirely in contemplation. But imperfect happiness, such as can be had here, consists first and principally in contemplation, but secondarily, in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions.\"[168]\n",
      " Human complexities, like reason and cognition, can produce well-being or happiness, but such form is limited and transitory. In temporal life, the contemplation of God, the infinitely Beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will. Beatitudo, or perfect happiness, as complete well-being, is to be attained not in this life, but the next.[169]\n",
      " Al-Ghazali (1058–1111), the Sufi thinker, wrote that \"The Alchemy of Happiness\", is a manual of religious instruction that is used throughout the Muslim world and widely practiced today.[170]\n",
      " Philosophy of happiness is often discussed in conjunction with ethics.[171] Traditional European societies, inherited from the Greeks and from Christianity, often linked happiness with morality. In this context, morality was the performance in a specific role in a certain kind of social life.[172]\n",
      " Happiness remains a difficult term for moral philosophy. Throughout the history of moral philosophy, there has been an oscillation between attempts to define morality in terms of consequences leading to happiness or defining it as nothing to do with happiness at all.[173]\n",
      " In psychology, connections between happiness and morality have been studied in a variety of ways. Empirical research suggests that laypeople's judgments of a person's happiness in part depend on perceptions of that person's morality, suggesting that judgments of others' happiness involve moral evaluation.[174] A large body of research also suggests that engaging in prosocial behavior can increase happiness.[175][176][177]\n",
      " Ethicists have made arguments for how humans should behave, either individually or collectively, based on the resulting happiness of such behavior. Utilitarians, such as John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, advocated the greatest happiness principle as a guide for ethical behavior. This principle states that actions are proportionately right or wrong by how much happiness or unhappiness they bring. Mill defines happiness as that which brings about an intended pleasure and avoids an unnecessary pain, and he defines unhappiness as the reverse, namely an action that brings about pain and not pleasure. He is quick to specify that pleasure and pain are to be understood in an Epicurean light, referring chiefly to the higher human pleasures of increased intellect, feelings, and moral sentiments not what one might call beastly pleasures of mere animal appetites.[178] Critics of this view include Thomas Carlyle, Ferdinand Tönnies and others within the German philosophical tradition. They posit that a greater happiness is to be found in choosing to suffer for others, rather than allowing others to suffer for them, declaring this to be a form of satisfying, and heroic, nobility.[179]\n",
      " Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found that those who exhibit volunteerism also have better current and future health and well-being.[180][181] In a study of older adults, those who volunteered had higher life satisfaction and will to live, and less depression, anxiety, and somatization.[182] Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages.[180][183][184] One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over 30 years and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one.[185] A study on adults aged 55 and older found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality.[186]\n",
      " Aristotle described eudaimonia (Greek: εὐδαιμονία) as the goal of human thought and action. Eudaimonia is often translated to mean happiness, but some scholars contend that \"human flourishing\" may be a more accurate translation.[187] Aristotle's use of the term in Nicomachiean Ethics extends beyond the general sense of happiness.[188]\n",
      " In the Nicomachean Ethics, written in 350 BCE, Aristotle stated that happiness (also being well and doing well) is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake, unlike riches, honour, health or friendship. He observed that men sought riches, or honour, or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy.[189] For Aristotle the term eudaimonia, which is translated as 'happiness' or 'flourishing' is an activity rather than an emotion or a state.[190] Eudaimonia (Greek: εὐδαιμονία) is a classical Greek word consists of the word \"eu\" (\"good\" or \"well-being\") and \"daimōn\" (\"spirit\" or \"minor deity\", used by extension to mean one's lot or fortune). Thus understood, the happy life is the good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way.[191]\n",
      " Specifically, Aristotle argued that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity. He arrived at this claim with the \"Function Argument\". Basically, if it is right, every living thing has a function, that which it uniquely does. For Aristotle human function is to reason, since it is that alone which humans uniquely do. And performing one's function well, or excellently, is good. According to Aristotle, the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life. Aristotle argued a second-best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity was the life of moral virtue.[191]\n",
      " The key question Aristotle seeks to answer is \"What is the ultimate purpose of human existence?\" A lot of people are seeking pleasure, health, and a good reputation. It is true that those have a value, but none of them can occupy the place of the greatest good for which humanity aims. It may seem like all goods are a means to obtain happiness, but Aristotle said that happiness is always an end in itself.[192]\n",
      " Friedrich Nietzsche critiqued the English Utilitarians' focus on attaining the greatest happiness, stating that \"Man does not strive for happiness, only the Englishman does\".[193] Nietzsche meant that making happiness one's ultimate goal and the aim of one's existence, in his words \"makes one contemptible.\" Nietzsche instead yearned for a culture that would set higher, more difficult goals than \"mere happiness.\" He introduced the quasi-dystopic figure of the \"last man\" as a kind of thought experiment against the utilitarians and happiness-seekers.[194][195]\n",
      " These small, \"last men\" who seek after only their own pleasure and health, avoiding all danger, exertion, difficulty, challenge, struggle are meant to seem contemptible to Nietzsche's reader. Nietzsche instead wants us to consider the value of what is difficult, what can only be earned through struggle, difficulty, pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and unhappiness truly play in creating everything of great worth in life, including all the highest achievements of human culture, not least of all philosophy.[194][196]\n",

      "We are stardust that somehow came alive and no one knows how or why that happened – no one knows what created life. Yet here we are – alive on a tiny speck of dirt and water floating through endless space. For most people including us, this mystery called life is most sacred, and it fills us with awe and wonder. This site is about how to relax into this mystery and be present in it every moment. This site is about being more aware of what’s obvious, not about finding something that’s hidden or lost. It’s about connecting with what’s sacred through your experiences, not through beliefs or faith. Our experience is that life itself is already so sacred that reverence is enough – that faith and beliefs need not even figure in unless you want them to. In short, this site is about how to replace words and thoughts about life with your direct experiences of life, and how to then evaluate and trust your experiences. It is about connecting directly with sacredness through increasing inner peace, love, fellowship, and goodness in your life. “Altogether, the results of the neuroscience of religion thus far suggest strongly that a religious instinct does indeed exist … [but] … surely there exist ways to find spiritual fulfillment without surrender and enslavement.” Edward O. Wilson;  The Meaning of Human Existence;The Social Conquest of Earth   Long ago our ancestors created religions and spiritualities that promised inner peace, love, fellowship, goodness, and connection with what’s most sacred. Today most people still want those promises fulfilled but many now distrust traditional religions and spiritualities because those often divide society and separate people from one another. The view on this web site is that traditional religions and spiritualities do provide ways to fulfill those promises, and some of those ways are described on this site along with new ways of fulfilling those promises developed by medicine and science in recent years. However our view is also that traditional religions and spiritualities are based on a flawed principle that undermines the fulfillment of those promises, that divides society, and that separates people from one another: Traditional religions and a great many spiritual teachings today are based on the flawed principle that someone else knows better than you what’s best for you. They require you to accept that they alone know how to connect you with what’s sacred and provide you with inner peace, love, fellowship and goodness. By accepting that requirement you thereby give them your power and your authority, which disempowers you and empowers them. They can then tell you what’s best for you because you gave them the power and authority to do so. This web site is based on a different principle, which is that you know better than anyone what actually works best for you; that you know better than anyone what increases or decreases your inner peace and brings you closer to what’s most sacred. With this approach you do not give your power to some other authority – you retain your power and you are the authority. With this approach you continue to learn by watching how others do things but you then decide what works best in your life. With this approach you choose friends and advisors who agree to be good listeners and provide their perspectives, and to respect you by not pushing their agendas and beliefs on you. In short, this web site is about learning to trust yourself and build your self-confidence. It’s about learning to connect with your intuition and trust what it’s telling you. It’s about learning to see and think for yourself. Through your own eyes you learned what the moon looks like: how could you learn that through the eyes of someone else? In that same way learn for yourself what expands inner peace, love, fellowship, goodness and what is most sacred in your life. Good luck. “Thank you for your wonderful website and instructions.

      "Home Healthy living Mental wellbeing Low mood and depression How to feel happier Try our 6 tips to help you be happier, more in control, and able to cope better with life’s ups and downs. If you have a lot of stress in your life, find ways to reduce it, such as learning a few time-management techniques or talking to your boss about changing your working hours. Introduce regular exercise and time to yourself. These are positive changes. Taking control of your time in this way can effectively reduce stress. If you have feelings of anxiety along with your stress, breathing techniques can help. Try this breathing exercise for stress. Try to see the funny side of situations and you’ll often be able to cope better. Jokes have a way of making worries seem less important. Doing things that you enjoy is also good for your emotional wellbeing. Simple activities like watching sports with a friend, having a soak in the bath, or meeting up with friends for coffee can all improve your day. Doing something you’re good at, such as cooking or dancing, is a good way to enjoy yourself and have a sense of achievement. Try to avoid things that seem enjoyable at the time but make you feel worse afterwards, such as drinking too much alcohol or eating junk food. Self-esteem is the way you feel about yourself. The best way to improve your self-esteem is to treat yourself as you would treat a valued friend, in a positive but honest way. Notice when you’re putting yourself down, such as thinking, “You’re so stupid for not getting that job”, and instead think, “Would I say that to my best friend?”. You probably wouldn’t. Tell yourself something positive instead, such as: “You’re a bright person, you’ll get the next job”. When times are hard, it’s tempting to drink alcohol because it “numbs” painful feelings. But it can exaggerate some feelings and make you feel angry or aggressive. It can also make you feel more depressed. Read more about the effects of alcohol on your health and get simple tips to help you cut down. Making healthy choices about your diet can make you feel emotionally stronger. You’re doing something positive for yourself, which lifts your self-esteem. A good diet helps your brain and body work efficiently, too. Aim to have a balanced diet that includes all the main food groups. Even moderate exercise releases chemicals in your brain that lift your mood. It can help you sleep better, have more energy and keep your heart healthy. Choose an exercise that you enjoy. If it helps, do it with a friend or listen to music. Adults should aim for 150 minutes a week. Around 7 to 8 hours is the average amount of sleep an adult needs for their body and mind to fully rest. Writing a “to do” list for the next day before bed can organise your thoughts and clear your mind of any distractions. Communication is important, whether it’s with a friend, family member or counsellor. Talking things through helps you to release tension, rather than keeping it inside. It helps strengthen your relationships and connect with people. Lots of people find talking to a counsellor about things that are troubling them very helpful. See benefits of talking therapy for more information. If you want to talk anonymously or urgently, you can call the Samaritans 24 hours a day on 116 123. Resilience is what allows you to cope with life’s ups and downs. Making something worthwhile out of painful times helps your resilience grow. Starting a support group to help others, or making something creative out of bad experiences by, for example, writing, painting or singing, can help you express pain and get through hard times.

      "Implement these simple tips to find joy. It’s perfectly normal to feel down, or as though you’re not the most joyful version of yourself. In these moments, and in life in general, you might find yourself wondering how to be happy.  “Happiness is not about the absence of negative emotion and the abundance of positive ones; it is about pursuing a life of meaning and purpose and living in accordance with your values,” explains Judy Ho, Ph.D., a clinical neuropsychologist in Manhattan Beach, CA. “When you do this, you will inevitably come across both highs and lows emotionally, but all lead to a deeper sense of joy.” So while happiness may look different to everybody, there are a number of changes and habits (big and small) that can lead you to a more joyful path.  Creating new habits and routines can be difficult, “But often simple lifestyle changes can have a profound influence on our mental health,” explains Joshua Hicks, Ph.D., professor, department of psychological and brain sciences, Texas A&M University. That’s why we’ve crafted a list of simple habits that will increase your levels of joy and fulfillment.  Ahead, find expert-backed tips to help you lead a fuller, more content life. Who knows, you just might find out more about yourself in the process. While it might seem like happiness feeds gratitude, it actually works the other way too. Practicing gratitude “can lead to people feeling more positive emotions and feeling an increase in motivation to engage in their life and make healthy choices,” explains Sari Chait, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist based in MA. Chait suggests maintaining a gratitude journal where you can jot down things both big and small that you feel grateful for. Starting a “mind-body morning routine” can go a long way toward setting you up for success each day and crafting an overall more positive mindset, Ho explains. Some morning routine ideas include a stretching routine, reading an inspirational quote, and setting your intentions for the day.  Ho suggests making a “joy list,” or creating a list of activities that bring you joy and committing yourself to doing one of those activities every day. By having a dedicated list of things that make you happy (like going for a walk or visiting your favorite coffee shop), you will always have something to fall back on as a pick-me-up on a bad day or something to begin each day with a more positive outlook. We know that exercise is good for our bodies, but did you know it’s also good for our mind? “Research has consistently shown that exercise helps improve mental health,” Chait explains. “Exercise leads to a release of endorphins which affect mood, and regular exercise can lead to a sense of success and to an improved self-confidence.” Try going for a long walk, dancing in your bedroom, or a yoga flow. Dehydration can negatively impact your mood and cognitive processes, research finds. So while drinking enough water might not seem like a top priority, if you’re looking to be happier…it definitely should be. Feel free to switch things up with lemon water, seltzer, or tea. “Having goals and feeling a sense of accomplishment” is one of the “main factors that have been shown to contribute to happiness,” Chait says. By setting out to do something important to you and accomplishing it, you create a sense of pride that Chait says has been shown to increase happiness. These goals can be big or small—if it’s something that speaks to you, that’s what matters most. Ho suggests challenging yourself by doing what she calls “getting into flow.” When time allows, do an activity that you are both capable of but also challenges you. The activity should be fun and interesting, as opposed to something where you may seek external validation or reward. Think: a challenging yoga pose or learning to knit. Making a plan each day will help you in terms of “understanding what you are doing and why you are doing,” Hicks says. Doing so “will make the task feel more meaningful and give you more motivation to pursue your daily goals,” in turn creating a sense of pride and accomplishment. One of the best ways to ensure personal growth is to check in with your values. Identifying your top values and evaluating if you are honoring them helps provide clarity to your day-to-day and allows you to connect with yourself. These are not things you can check off like goals, but ideas that you believe in and contribute to your character, like integrity and spirituality.  If you have trouble making decisions, you may feel unsettled or unclear on your life path or day-to-day routine. “Values-based decision making” can help, Ho says. Whenever you feel you are up against two decisions, ask yourself which choice honors your values (like the ones you identified above) more.   Personal growth and maintaining healthy habits take work—and it’s perfectly fine to fall short sometimes. “Cut yourself some slack when you fail,” Hicks says. “Try not to ruminate over lapses of self-control. As long as you commit to practicing it you will get better.” Try reciting some positive affirmations as a way to ensure you stay kind to yourself while on a path toward happiness. Deep breathing is a great way to reduce stress and center yourself so that you can continue moving forward with your goals. “When you engage in deep belly breathing, you activate the parasympathetic nervous system and your body starts to relax,” Nicole Issa, Psy.D., a licensed psychologist and founder of PVD Psychological Associates previously explained in conversation about how to relieve stress. Try these mindful breathing exercises. Being outdoors can boost your happiness big time. “When we are in nature we tend to forget about ourselves and our problems,” Hicks says. “Something about this process not only helps us destress but taking a step back from our problems can sometimes help us see them in a different light.” A simple walk in the park, visiting a nearby trail, or even taking your lunch break outside can do wonders. Try out “practical mindfulness,” Ho suggests. This means doing something “present-minded with complete focus and no distractions.” It can be something simple, and ideally something you do every day—like making coffee, showering, or brushing your teeth. It’s all about being present, in the moment, and savoring it for exactly what that moment is. This type of mindfulness can help you take on the rest of your day with a calm, positive headspace. Ho also suggests trying a walking meditation, which helps you stay mindful and active at the same time. Go for either a brief or long walk, and as you walk “narrate your surroundings to yourself so that you can be focused on the environment and what’s going on, noticing the little details as opposed to being lost in your thoughts,” Ho explains. Going to therapy is often one of the best things a person can do for their overall wellness. “If you find that you can’t get out of your rut, committing to see a professional is a great option,” Hicks says. “Sometimes it just takes advice from an expert to give us insight and get us back on the right track.” The relationships we have with others have an extreme impact on our emotional health and happiness. In fact, Hicks emphasizes making connecting with friends and loved ones a top priority. “A simple positive interaction with another human being does wonders for our mental health and well-being.” A cup of coffee with an old friend, a catch-up session over video, or putting yourself out there by making new friends in your community are all things you can do to reap those social benefits. Connecting with others is crucial, but connecting with ourselves is another important aspect of social wellness. Solitude is a “biological need,” one study reveals. It “supports identity development as well as intimacy with others” and even “promotes happiness.” So feel free to take the time you need to recharge your social battery and reconnect with yourself. Boundaries are key for establishing healthy relationships—which are the only kinds of relationships you should accept on your journey toward a happier you. The first step toward setting healthy boundaries is to acknowledge when you’re doing too much for others and not enough for yourself, as well as “learning to say no,” as explained in our 14-Day Happiness Challenge. Finding a new hobby is a great way to connect with yourself and meet new people. “Hobbies help us relax and help mitigate boredom and other things that are antithetical to happiness,” Hicks explains. “Interacting with people who make us feel authentic is very important for our experience of meaningfulness.” The reward we get from helping others through volunteering often leads to an increase in happiness. “Helping someone else leads to increased positive emotions,” Chait explains. “Volunteering also often includes some amount of social interactions which has been shown to be a strong contributor to happiness.” It also offers the opportunity to try new things—like working with animals or children and offers the opportunity to learn new skills.

Here's some of the best research that we've found on personal happiness. Content Writer @ Buffer Happiness is something we think about a lot at Buffer. It's been a cornerstone of our culture from the beginning (just take a look at this slide deck about it from way back in 2013). Though our values have evolved since then, you'll still see echoes of how important happiness is for us to cultivate in our most up-to-date version.  No surprise then that I thought it would be interesting to dig into the research on how to become a happier person. Spoiler: there's a lot of it! After combing through as much as I could, here are 11 of the simplest things that make you happy, according to science.  You've likely heard of endorphins, the pain and stress-relieving hormones released when you exercise. But the release of these feel-good chemicals is not the only dramatic effect that exercise can have on your body. Getting moving also triggers the release of more happiness hormones, serotonin and dopamine. On top of that, exercise increases your heart rate, which in turn pumps more oxygen to your brain. A well-oxygenated brain is as great as it sounds — many studies have found that this can help manage anxiety and depression, too. In Shawn Achor’s book, The Happiness Advantage, he cites a fascinating study on this. (The book is a great read, by the way — I'll be referring back to it a lot in this article!). In the study, three groups of patients treated their depression with either medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. The results of this study surprised me. Although all three groups experienced similar improvements in their happiness levels to begin with, the follow-up assessments proved to be radically different: \"The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate,\" Achor writes. \"Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent.\" Exercise can help you to relax, increase your brain power, and improve your body image. A study in the Journal of Health Psychology found that people who exercised felt better about their bodies, even when they saw no physical changes. The best part? This doesn’t mean you need to commit to a miles-long run or strenuous HIIT class every day to have a happy life — just 10 minutes of movement a day has been proven to be enough to boost happiness levels, according to The Journal of Happiness Studies. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), sleep deprivation dramatically impairs memory and concentration, disrupts your metabolism, and increases levels of stress hormones.  Beyond the severe physical consequences of getting enough sleep (“People who chronically fail to get enough sleep may actually be cutting their lives short,” the APA says), you don’t need me to tell you that a bad night’s sleep can seriously impact your mood.  A study published in the journal Sleep, which analyzed the sleep patterns of 30,594 people over the age of 16 in the U.K. across a period of 4 years, found that insufficient or poor sleep worsened emotional states.  With the widely used General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), a survey that helps determine health-related quality of life, they made some interesting comparisons with participants who got more and better sleep:  “Changes on the GHQ are comparable with those seen in mental health professionals completing an eight-week program of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy designed to improve psychological well-being,” researchers write.  “They are also comparable with the average improvement in well-being shown by U.K. lottery winners two years after a medium-sized lottery win.” Read: Getting more sleep will boost your mood as much as winning the lottery.  Our commute to the office can have a powerful impact on our happiness. The fact that we tend to do this twice a day, five days a week, makes it unsurprising that its effect would build up over time and make us less and less happy. Several studies have found that happiness and commute time are inversely proportional. As this paper in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health put it: “The longer the commute, the lower the satisfaction with work and life; the length of commuting can also cause damage to health, affecting physical health and causing inactivity.” Little wonder then that a commute that is a matter of seconds — i.e. the distance between your bedroom/kitchen/bathroom and your desk — is a huge factor in happiness and well-being. A 2023 study by Tracking Happiness found that remote workers are 20% happier than their in-office counterparts. In our most recent State of Remote Work report, 91 percent of respondents had had a positive experience of working remotely, while 98 percent said they would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, for the rest of their careers. Social time is highly valuable when it comes to improving our happiness, even for introverts. Several studies have found that time spent with friends and family makes a big difference to how happy we feel, generally. I love the way Harvard happiness expert Daniel Gilbert explains it: “We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends, and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.” Psychiatrist George Vaillant is the director of a 72-year study of the lives of 268 men, one of the most comprehensive longitudinal studies in history. In an interview in 2008, he was asked about what he'd learned from the men. Vaillant’s response: \"That the only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people.\" He shared insights of the study with The Atlantic's Joshua Wolf Shenk on how the men’s social connections made a difference to their overall happiness: “The men’s relationships at age 47, he found, predicted late-life adjustment better than any other variable, except defenses,\" Wolf Shenk writes. \"Good sibling relationships seem especially powerful: 93 percent of the men who were thriving at age 65 had been close to a brother or sister when younger.\" Great news for those of us who spend most of our days at our desks: you don't need to spend hours in the sunshine to reap the benefits of good old-fashioned fresh air. Spending time outdoors in a green space for just 20 minutes was enough to boost well-being, according to a study in the International Journal of Environmental Health Research. “Some people may go to the park and just enjoy nature,\" study co-author Hon Yuen told TIME. \"It’s not that they have to be rigorous in terms of exercise. You relax and reduce stress, and then you feel more happy.” If the idea of finding a space green enough to be considered 'nature' feels a bit far off, fear not — the study had participants visit urban parks in Birmingham, U.K., not Yosemite.  A study from the University of Sussex also found that being outdoors might contribute towards a happier life: “Being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, participants were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all-natural environments than they were in urban environments.” Interestingly, temperature can play a role, too. The American Meteorological Society published research that found current temperature has a bigger effect on our happiness than variables like wind speed and humidity, or even the average temperature over the course of a day. It also found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C (57°F), so keep an eye on the weather forecast before heading outside for your 20 minutes of fresh air. There are plenty of studies that show volunteering, random acts of kindness, or just giving someone else a compliment can boost your mood. In his book Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being, University of Pennsylvania professor Martin Seligman explains that helping others can improve our own lives: \"We scientists have found that doing a kindness produces the single most reliable momentary increase in well-being of any exercise we have tested.\" If we go back to Shawn Achor’s book, he says this about helping others: \"When researchers interviewed more than 150 people about their recent purchases, they found that money spent on activities — such as concerts and group dinners out — brought far more pleasure than material purchases like shoes, televisions, or expensive watches. Spending money on other people, called 'prosocial spending', also boosts happiness.\" Giving time, rather than money, is an option too: volunteering could be particularly beneficial. In a paper in the Journal of Happiness Studies, researchers examined data from nearly 70,000 subjects in the U.K. They found that people who had volunteered in the past year were more satisfied with their lives and rated their overall health as better.  They also discovered that volunteering more frequently meant greater benefits. Those who volunteered at least once a month reported better mental health than those who helped out irregularly or not at all.  Fun fact: The simple act of smiling causes the brain to release those feel-good hormones dopamine and serotonin.  Smiling itself can make us feel better, but it’s more effective when we back it up with positive thoughts, according to this study published in the Academy of Management Journal: “Customer-service workers who fake smiles throughout the day worsen their mood and withdraw from work, affecting productivity. But workers who smile as a result of cultivating positive thoughts — such as a tropical vacation or a child’s recital — improve their mood and withdraw less.” One of our previous posts goes into even more detail about the science of smiling. As opposed to actually taking a holiday, planning a vacation or just a break from work can improve our happiness. A study published in the journal Applied Research in Quality of Life showed that the highest spike in happiness came during the planning stage of a vacation as employees enjoyed a sense of anticipation, which boosted happiness for eight weeks. After the vacation, happiness quickly dropped back to baseline levels for most people. If you can’t take the time for a vacation right now, or even a night out with friends, put something on the calendar — even if it’s a month or a year down the road. Then whenever you need a boost of happiness, remind yourself about it. Meditation is often touted as an important habit for improving focus, clarity, and attention span, as well as helping to keep you calm. It turns out it’s also useful for improving your happiness. A study by Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation.  After the course, they scanned participants' brains again — and found that the parts of their brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank. According to Shawn Achor, meditation can make you happier long-term: “Studies show that in the minutes right after meditating, we experience feelings of calm and contentment, as well as heightened awareness and empathy. And, research even shows that regular meditation can permanently rewire the brain to raise levels of happiness.” If sitting down to meditate feels a bit intimidating, the simple act of taking a few deep breaths can work wonders. A study in Frontiers of Human Neuroscience, (titled ‘How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life’), found that deep breathing can reduce stress and increase emotional control.  Focusing on the breath is also a useful grounding practice in meditation and a great place to start. This is a seemingly simple strategy, but I’ve personally found it to make a huge difference to my outlook.  There are lots of ways to practice gratitude, from keeping a journal of things you’re grateful for, sharing three good things that happen each day with a friend or your partner, and going out of your way to show gratitude when others help you. In an experiment where some participants took note of things they were grateful for each day, their moods were improved just from this simple practice. Participants \"exhibited heightened well-being across several, though not all, of the outcome measures across the three studies, relative to the comparison groups,\" the authors of the study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology write. \"The effect on positive affect appeared to be the most robust finding. Results suggest that a conscious focus on blessings may have emotional and interpersonal benefits.\" The Journal of Happiness Studies published a paper that used letters of gratitude to test how being grateful can affect our levels of happiness. Participants included 219 men and women who wrote three letters of gratitude over a three-week period. \"Results indicated that writing letters of gratitude increased participants’ happiness and life satisfaction while decreasing depressive symptoms.\" Gratitude is still one of Buffer’s core values and something Bufferoos try to practice in their day-to-day work. A simple way we express gratitude to our coworkers every day is through our ‘#culture-gratitude’ channel in Slack, where we share when someone goes above and beyond in their work (which is pretty often).  Here’s a recent message from Maria, our Chief Product Officer, about Content Writer Tami: In an article for Psychology Today, Paula Davis J.D., M.A.P.P (who has a Master’s degree in positive psychology) writes that when it comes to happiness-boosting activities, one size does not fit all. “You tailor your workout to your specific fitness goals — happy people do the same thing with their emotional goals,” she says. “Some strategies that are known to promote happiness are just too corny for me, but the ones that work best allow me to practice acts of kindness, express gratitude, and become fully engaged.” A bonus point you didn't ask for: it’s interesting to note that as we get older, particularly past middle age, we tend to grow happier naturally. There’s still some debate over why this happens, but scientists have got a few ideas. According to this article in Perspectives on Psychological Science, researchers write: \"Older people shown pictures of faces or situations tend to focus on and remember the happier ones more and the negative ones less. Other studies have discovered that as people age, they seek out situations that will lift their moods — for instance, pruning social circles of friends or acquaintances who might bring them down.  \"Still other work finds that older adults learn to let go of loss and disappointment over unachieved goals, and hew their goals toward greater wellbeing.\" So if you thought being old would make you miserable, rest assured that it’s likely you’ll develop a more positive outlook than you probably have now.  140,000+ small businesses like yours use Buffer to build their brand on social media every month Personal brand experts walked this writer through exactly how to switch up her personal brand — and offered some more general advice, too.

      "Becoming Minimalist Own less. Live more. Written by joshua becker · 56 Comments  Last updated: May 1, 2022  Happiness is a state of mind. Specifically, it is a state of “well-being and contentment.”  But the definition can be tricky and assumptions about the word can cause confusion. Many don’t even realize learning how to be happy is something that can be intentionally practiced. Some people, when they hear the word ‘happiness,’ assume it is speaking of an emotion such as pleasure or joy. For them, it is what people feel in the immediate here and now. This is the reason some people say, “Don’t pursue happiness, seek joy. Happiness is fickle and fading, joy remains forever.” But this short-term definition of happiness is not how everyone understands the word. Some define it to mean long-term satisfaction.  In fact, when I speak of experiencing happiness in life, I am not thinking of short-term emotions at all. I think of a quality of living—a much longer-term view of the word. Both definitions are understood to be correct and speak of different realities. But are they really that different? I don’t think so.  After all, a long-term experience of life satisfaction is almost certainly made up of many short-term feelings of joy and pleasure. Does that mean every day is a great day with no trials, temptations, or downturns? Certainly not. But it does mean when we look back at the many seasons of life, we can look back satisfied at how we navigated them. The long-term feeling of life satisfaction is most experienced when we embrace the emotion of joy in the here and now. And we accomplish that by taking steps each day to be happy. Here are some tips on how to be happier starting today. The most important thing to realize about happiness is that it is not an outcome of current circumstances. Just the opposite, happiness is a choice. Is this easier on some days than others? Absolutely. But if you get caught in the trap of thinking your circumstances need to change before you can be happy, you’ll never, ever get there.  There are good things in your life right now: you are alive, you are fed, you are healthy, you have family and friends, and you have opportunities each day to pursue meaningful work. Maybe not all of those are true for you right now, but certainly some of them are—which means there is good in your life that you can focus on.  Marine Sgt. Jonny Joseph Jones lost both of his legs in an explosion while serving in Afghanistan. I was struck by a quote of his I saw recently. He said  this, “People ask how I stay so positive after losing my legs… I simply ask how they stay so negative when they have both of theirs.”  Happiness is about perspective and if you’re looking for reasons to be happy, you’ll probably find them. Happy people focus on positive thoughts. No matter how you choose to define happiness—short-term or long-term—comparison will rob you of it. Whether we compare our finances, our body type, our vacations, our talents, our house size or our shoe size, there are no winners in the game of comparison. But here’s the good news: Nobody is forcing you to play! You can stop any time you want. Be grateful for what you have, appreciate who you are, work hard every day to live your best life, and stop comparing yourself to others. In the world of positive psychology, there are a few themes that emerge every time happiness is studied. Among those recurring themes, we find gratitude and generosity.  Both of which can only be understood correctly when we see them as disciplines rather than responses. A discipline is something we practice regardless of our circumstances. If you are waiting for enough money to become generous, you’ll never get there. Likewise, if you are waiting for everything to be perfect to be grateful, you’ll never experience it. Choose to be thankful today. And choose to be generous with your time and money. Making them both a discipline in your life will result in a happier today… and tomorrow.  Possessions are necessary for life, but our society has seemed to confuse consumerism with happiness. Marketers work hard to convince us their products are not just needed for life, but that they are essential for happiness.  Slowly but surely, we begin to believe their empty promises and waste our lives pursuing things that can never satisfy. We sacrifice time, money, energy, and focus chasing and accumulating things we do not need.  These excess possessions add stress, worry, and burden onto our lives. Want to become a bit more happy today? Go declutter a closet or drawer and start to challenge consumerism in your life.  Robert J. Waldinger is an American psychiatrist and Professor at Harvard Medical School where he is best known for directing the world’s longest-running longitudinal study tracking the health and mental well-being of a group of 724 American men for 76 years. One thing that he has learned, and has been confirmed by studies elsewhere, is that relationships hold the key to happiness:  Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives, the study revealed. Those ties protect people from life’s discontents, help to delay mental and physical decline, and are better predictors of long and happy lives than social class, IQ, or even genes. We don’t get to control every aspect of our relationships (we didn’t choose our family, for example). But we can all take steps to be a good friend. And good friends tend to attract healthy community. Annie Dillard is credited for saying, “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” And she is right. Our lives are filled with days, our days are filled with hours, and this present hour is filled with whatever you chose to fill it with. So pursue healthy habits that add value to your hours, days, and lifetime. Spend time outside. Eat healthy. Exercise regularly. Quit smoking. Put down your cell phone. Obsess less. Work hard. Pray often. And get enough sleep. The pursuit of self comes natural to us. We don’t need to be reminded to pursue our own self-interests. We pursue self-survival, self-promotion, self-actualization, and self-exaltation as if it is hardwired in our genes. But the most efficient pathway to lasting happiness and fulfillment is not to look only at your own interests, but also to the interests of others. When we shift our focus off of ourselves, we live lives of greater meaning and greater contribution. When we serve others without concern over what we might receive in return, we experience the beauty of selfless love. The size of our universe (and happiness) begins to expand exponentially. It is no small thing that happiness is pursued by so many. Let’s make sure we find it—in both the short term and the long term. \n",
      "Rick Campos says  March 4, 2024 at 6:21 AM I think the fact that we are all reading this is the point. These are all good reminders to cause us to think, maybe shift some thoughts around, maybe some habits that get in the way of ones happiness. Maybe it’s just a sounding board or jumping off point to kick start us to better thinking, awareness.\n",

      "This page was last updated November 2023. If you want to do as much good as possible with the resources you have, here is one real-life choice you face. For about $6,000 you could: Which option will do the most good? This is a challenging question – how can we possibly compare saving lives, reducing poverty, and treating mental illness? At the Happier Lives Institute, we believe it’s possible to answer this question by comparing the effects on people’s subjective wellbeing (self-reports of happiness and life satisfaction). What’s more, taking this approach leads to some surprising results. The following sections introduce the key ideas and guiding principles that define our approach. Throughout, you’ll find many links to our growing list of research reports as well as the academic literature we draw on. We begin with a general overview before expanding on each idea in greater depth. We think that wellbeing is how people feel during or about their lives i.e. how happy or satisfied they are. When we talk about doing good, what most of us really have in mind is improving people’s wellbeing. But what is ‘wellbeing’? We believe that it is people’s subjective wellbeing that we should ultimately care about. Health and wealth aren’t important in themselves, they only matter because they improve our subjective wellbeing. Even if you think that happiness or life satisfaction are not the only things that matter, you will probably still care about them to some extent. Subjective wellbeing can be measured in a scientifically valid and reliable way through self-reports. Social scientists have been doing large-scale population surveys since the 1960s. A typical question is “Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays? (0-10)” Some people are very sceptical about putting numbers on feelings but we don’t think their objections are serious enough to give up on happiness surveys. If we want to know how people’s lives are going, we need to ask them.  Measuring and increasing happiness across society is a very old idea that was briefly abandoned and is now returning. Many ancient philosophers and Enlightenment thinkers understood happiness as the goal of life. But in the early 20th-century, the rise of behaviourism amongst economists and psychologists led to scepticism that we could or should measure feelings and we started using objective measures of social progress instead, such as GDP.  In recent years, there has been a resurgence in support for a wellbeing approach amongst academics, policymakers, and civil society that is now gathering force. For the first time in human history, we can identify the best ways to improve global happiness in a scientifically rigorous way. Due to the rapidly increasing amount of wellbeing research conducted in recent decades, we now have a much better idea of the factors that have the biggest impact on subjective wellbeing. However, this work has barely begun and we don’t think anyone can confidently say what the top priorities are yet.  Current global priorities may change significantly if we adopt a subjective wellbeing approach. Of course, policymakers and philanthropists have already done a lot of thinking about how they can best use their resources to improve people’s lives.  After all, haven’t we often made decisions with people’s happiness and life satisfaction in mind, even if we haven’t directly measured those things? Unfortunately, psychological research shows that we make predictable mistakes when thinking about what makes us, and others, happy. In broad terms, we place too much importance on what we can see objectively, such as wealth and physical health, and overlook people’s emotional and social lives. The Happier Lives Institute was founded in 2019 to find the most cost-effective ways to make lives happier. We currently focus on identifying high-impact funding opportunities in low-income countries because we expect that’s where money will go furthest. Our most thorough evaluation so far looks at the cost-effectiveness of providing psychotherapy for people living with depression compared to providing $1,000 cash transfers to very poor families. We estimate that psychotherapy is more cost-effective – the effect of therapy is slightly larger and it is much cheaper to provide. This challenges existing thinking about how to do the most good and suggests that treating mental health conditions should be a higher priority for decision-makers.   More research is needed to work out what the priorities should be. Mental health could turn out to be the most pressing global problem, but we may find other problems that are even more important. In the near future, we plan to evaluate a wide range of interventions including deworming programmes, cataract surgery, lead regulation, immigration policy, and access to pain relief. There are also some thorny philosophical issues related to the nature and measurement of wellbeing that need further thought, including how to compare saving lives to improving lives. Our vision is a world where everyone lives their happiest life. We want to see a world where governments and philanthropists base their decisions, at least in part, on the best wellbeing evidence. If you think that making people happier sounds like a good idea, we encourage you to do what you can to make this happen. At the end of this article, we provide advice for donors, researchers, entrepreneurs, advocates, and policymakers. The claim that subjective wellbeing matters morally may seem to require no defence. But let’s put these ideas in their full theoretical context. In this section, we explain what wellbeing is, summarise the three philosophical theories of wellbeing, and introduce the three measures of subjective wellbeing that relate to each theory. In philosophy, wellbeing refers to what is intrinsically (or non-instrumentally) good for someone. Instrumental goods, like wealth, are only valuable as a means to something else, whereas wellbeing is what ultimately makes someone’s life go well. Understanding what makes life go well is of obvious value: every plausible ethical view holds that wellbeing matters in principle, and in practice, we do put great effort into improving the wellbeing of ourselves and others. Theories of wellbeing are generally divided into three families: hedonism, desire-fulfilment, and the objective list. The following sections provide a brief summary of each.  Learn more: The philosophy of wellbeing  Hedonists claim that wellbeing consists in an overall positive balance of pleasure over pain. In other words, what is good for you is whatever feels good to you. It seems implausible that something you haven’t experienced directly could make a difference to your wellbeing. If you never feel its impact, how could it affect your life?  The most well-known objection to hedonism is the ‘experience machine’ (Nozick, 1974). Imagine that you are offered the opportunity to spend the rest of your life inside a virtual reality capable of simulating any experience. Once plugged in, you could indulge in any number of pleasurable or happy experiences without ever wishing or even knowing you had left the real world. Hedonists think that plugging into the experience machine would make your life go better. But many people would reject the prospect of leaving behind the real world for a simulated existence, however pleasurable. This is often because they desire to do things in the ‘real’ world and the mere experience of (apparently) doing them is no substitute for in fact doing them. This leads us to the second family of theories. Desire-fulfilment (or preference satisfaction) theories claim that it is the fulfilment of a person’s desires that makes their life go well. It is not the feeling or experience of a desire being satisfied that matters but that the desire is, in fact, satisfied. You want to actually climb Everest, rather than merely believe that you have. If you only wanted to feel satisfied, your view would also be vulnerable to the experience machine objection.  A general objection to this family of theories is that the objects of desire (friendships, success, happiness etc.) are not valuable because they are desired. Instead, they are desired because they are valuable, and so desire theories have got the explanation the wrong way around. Plant (2020) notes that desire-fulfilment theories are also vulnerable to ‘auto-maximisation’. This means that you can make your life better by simply choosing desires that are trivially easy to fulfil. For example, if your only desire is that Paris is the capital of France, hey presto, your life goes best. There also seems to be no way for these theories to apply to animals that lack desires about how their lives go overall, such as dogs, who we tend to think do have wellbeing. Learn more: A critique of desire-fulfilment theories  Watch: Michael Plant presents the critique at the Wellbeing Research Centre Objective list theories claim there are some things that improve your life that may be neither pleasurable nor desired by you. Classic items for this list include success, friendship, knowledge, virtuous behaviour, and health. Such items are ‘objective’ in the sense of being concerned with facts beyond both a person’s conscious experience and/or their desires.  Defenders of objective list theories might object to the previous two theories as naively simplistic – wellbeing cannot be reduced to a single element, life is far more complicated than that. Yet, pluralism, the view that more than one thing makes up wellbeing, faces its own challenges. If the items have a characteristic feature in common then you should replace the list with that single feature. If not, then how should you make trade-offs between the different items on the list? Whichever theory you think is true, happiness and life satisfaction will play some role. For hedonists, happiness is all that matters. On desire theories, life satisfaction – how your life goes compared to how you desire it to go – is central and happiness matters because it is something we desire. If you favour the objective list, it would be odd if neither happiness nor life satisfaction were on it. Therefore, it’s not particularly controversial to claim that subjective wellbeing is something we care about. The more controversial claim, which we’ll come to later, is that we can measure psychological states through self-reports in a scientifically valid and reliable way Even if you agree that subjective wellbeing matters, there are still questions about which theory of wellbeing is correct and determining the extent of practical disagreement between these theories is a further empirical challenge. The good news is that uncertainty about the correct theory of wellbeing does not prevent us from reaching some understanding of how to improve wellbeing in practice. This is because the three theories of wellbeing often agree on the things that lead to wellbeing: the person who is happy, successful, wise, and loved will have high wellbeing on all plausible theories. Nevertheless, the extent to which different theories of wellbeing suggest different priorities in practice remains an open question requiring further research. Subjective wellbeing (SWB) is an umbrella term for self-reported ratings of thoughts and feelings about life which fall into three main categories: hedonic, cognitive, and eudaimonic. SWB and happiness are often used interchangeably but SWB is a broader concept incorporating overall evaluations of life as well as momentary experiences of happiness. In the following sections, we describe each of these three categories in more detail and explain how they are measured. We leave discussion of why we think such measures are scientifically valid for Section 2. All sensations can be placed on a single scale of ‘pleasantness’ and we define happiness as a net balance of pleasant over unpleasant experience.  Using hedonic measures, the only two components of happiness are intensity (how pleasant/unpleasant something feels) and duration (how long the sensation lasts). Hedonic measures are sometimes split into positive affect and negative affect, which can each be measured separately and have different determinants. The former refers to pleasant emotions such as joy, contentment, and elation; the latter to unpleasant emotions such as sadness, fear, and anxiety.  Affect data is commonly collected using questionnaires based on PANAS and SPANE scales. Another measure is the day reconstruction method (DRM) in which participants break their previous day into episodes (like scenes in a movie) and state, for each episode, what they were doing, how they felt, and who they were with. A more accurate, but less common measure, is the experience sampling method (ESM) where participants are prompted, one or more times a day, to record how they are feeling at that particular moment. Although costly to implement, ESM avoids the problem of asking participants to remember how they felt. This is a significant benefit, given how error-prone our memories can be. Cognitive measures of wellbeing are based on the view that happiness consists in having a favourable attitude towards one’s life as a whole. Life satisfaction is usually found by asking, “how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?” on a scale from 0 “not at all” to 10 “completely”.  Most of the SWB literature has focussed on measures of life satisfaction up to now and there are two main reasons for this.  The first is practical. It is much easier to collect data on life evaluations than on experiences. Participants usually answer questions about life satisfaction in less than 30 seconds and it can easily be included in existing population surveys. By comparison, the ESM and DRM require more work from respondents; the former is intrusive and the latter takes respondents about 40 minutes to complete. Affect data from PANAS and SPANE questionnaires are strongly correlated with life satisfaction but the correlation is weaker for data collected using the ESM or DRM methods.  The second reason is moral. Life evaluations are sometimes thought by economists to be a measure of decision utility (what people choose to do). Economists have historically taken this to be of greater moral importance than experienced utility (how life is experienced). Learn more: A critique of life satisfaction measures Watch: Michael Plant presents the critique at the Wellbeing Research Centre Eudaimonic measures seek to quantify traits like virtue, character, and wisdom as well as concepts related to fulfilling our potential such as meaning, purpose, and flourishing. Eudaimonic measures are often regarded as a core component of SWB, particularly in the field of positive psychology. However, it is unclear whether measures of meaning are really measures of wellbeing and little data has been collected on them. Perhaps you are sceptical of the claim that we can measure subjective concepts like happiness. However, the last few decades have seen an explosion of research on subjective wellbeing as social scientists and policymakers grow increasingly confident in the validity of these measures. This section provides a range of evidence that we hope will go some way to alleviating your concerns.  Before we begin, let’s introduce two key concepts: reliability and validity. A measure is reliable if it gives the same results each time (assuming the subject of measurement hasn’t changed). A measure that gave a random score each time would not be measuring anything. A measure is valid if it captures the underlying phenomenon it set out to capture. Let’s discuss each concept in turn. Learn more: The measurement of wellbeing  A range of statistical tests has been conducted to confirm the reliability of subjective wellbeing measures. We quote here from the OECD Guidelines on Measuring Subjective Well-being (2013). On hedonic measures:  “Diener et al. (2009) report…the positive, negative, and affective balance subscales of their Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) have alphas of 0.84, 0.88, and 0.88 respectively. Krueger and Schkade (2008) report test-retest correlations of 0.5 and 0.7 for a range of different measures of affect over a two-week period.” On cognitive measures:  “Test-retest results for a single-item life evaluation measure tend to yield correlations of between 0.5 and 0.7 for a time period of 1 day to 2 weeks (Krueger and Schkade, 2008). Michalos and Kahlke (2010) report that a single-item measure of life satisfaction had a correlation of 0.65 for a one-year period and 0.65 for a two-year period.” Subjective wellbeing measures have also been subjected to a range of validation tests. The main test is construct validity – whether the measure performs in the world the way that theory predicts. Socialising, relaxing, and eating are associated with higher levels of positive affect, while commuting, working, and housework are associated with low levels of positive affect (Kahneman et al., 2009). Higher incomes are associated with higher life satisfaction and affect (up to a certain point) all around the world, at both the individual and country level (Stevenson & Wolfers, 2013). Stable, wealthy, well-governed countries score highly on average life satisfaction (Finland, Denmark, and Norway average around 7.5/10). On the other hand, war-torn and low-income countries do badly: South Sudan, Central African Republic, and Afghanistan average about 3/10 (World Happiness Report, 2021).  Hedonic and evaluative measures relate to different aspects of wellbeing so we shouldn’t expect them to give the same results all the time. For example, Deaton and Stone (2013) found that affect measures vary on the days of the week, improve with age, and only respond to income up to a point whereas evaluative measures correlate with income (even at high levels of income), are often U-shaped in relation to age, and do not vary over the days of the week. However, for practical purposes, affect and life satisfaction measures generally go together so we can use the latter as a substitute for the former. However, some caution is still needed as the measures differ in the degree to which different things matter and sometimes whether those things are positive or negative. A long-standing worry about subjective wellbeing measures is whether the numbers represent the same thing to different people at different times (Ferrer-i-Carbonell & Frijters, 2004). For example, if two people say they are 5/10 happy, can we assume they are as happy as each other? More technically, the question is whether subjective scales are cardinally comparable – does a one-point change represent the same size change at all points of the scale?  If the scales are merely ordinal (the numbers represent a ranking but contain no information on the relative magnitudes of differences), it will not be possible to use subjective scales to determine the best ways to increase global wellbeing.  The image below is taken from a 2018 survey by YouGov which asked people to score different words on a 0-10 scale from very negative to very positive. The results demonstrate that people tend to score positive and negative words in very similar ways which should increase our confidence in people’s ability to assign numbers to their subjective feelings in a meaningful and consistent way.  Learn more: The cardinality of subjective wellbeing scales  Watch: Michael Plant presents at a workshop on wellbeing measurement Even if subjective wellbeing measures are generally good, it doesn’t mean they are flawless. But the fact there are some measurement issues is not sufficient to declare the scales invalid. If your bathroom scales give you an implausible result, you wouldn’t conclude that measuring weight is impossible. Much has been made of studies that find seemingly irrelevant factors can affect self-reports of wellbeing, such as finding a coin or being asked about your love life or politics just before you report your score. However, the impact of such factors is relatively limited and has not been borne out by the wider literature. Diener et al. (2013) find that 60-80% of the variability in life satisfaction is associated with long-term factors and the remainder with occasion-specific issues and measurement errors. When large populations are surveyed, random errors will wash out and such issues can also be minimised through careful survey design. Measuring and increasing happiness is not a new idea but efforts to conduct large population surveys only started a few decades ago. Why? What’s changed? In the following sections, we present a brief history of Western thinking about happiness over the last 2,500 years and highlight the current trends in wellbeing research. Aristotle used the term ‘eudaimonia’ for the ultimate goal of life. Wealth, health, and relationships were all considered to be important, but Aristotle placed particular emphasis on virtue as an essential component of a fulfilling life. Later schools of philosophy focused on specific aspects of Aristotle’s ideas. The Epicureans favoured a life based on friendship and simple pleasures whilst the Stoics emphasised the control of emotions in challenging situations. These two approaches to the good life spread throughout the Roman empire, aided by the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher. However, as monotheistic religions spread across the world over the following centuries, people came to believe that happiness would be found in the afterlife as the reward for living a virtuous life on Earth. It was not until the late 1600s that philosophers began to re-establish happiness as the goal of life, with John Locke’s claim that, “the necessity of pursuing true happiness is the foundation of all liberty”. In the 18th century, Francis Hutcheson was the first to argue that we should produce “the greatest happiness for the greatest number”, an idea that influenced many great thinkers. Thomas Jefferson wrote that “the life and happiness of the people is the first and only object of good government”, Adam Smith studied economic methods to create the greatest happiness, and Jeremy Bentham coined the term utilitarianism in his famous book, The Principle of Morals and Legislation. John Stuart Mill inspired many social reforms based on utilitarian principles and the economist Francis Edgeworth discussed the need for a ‘hedonometer’ to measure happiness. In the 20th century, the psychologists Ivan Pavlov and John B Watson claimed it was impossible to know what occurred inside people’s minds or how they felt. They argued that we could only study how people behaved and how this was affected by external stimuli. In 1932, Lionel Robbins (an economist) dismissed the idea that it was possible to compare the happiness of one person with another and argued that economists should only observe revealed behaviour, rather than attempting to measure how people feel. This turn to behaviourism led to GDP (gross domestic product) becoming the primary measure of national wellbeing in the post-war period, despite the protests of its inventor, Simon Kuznets, who said, “the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income”.  Criticism of GDP as a measure of national progress has grown stronger in recent years. In 1974, Richard Easterlin showed that wellbeing in the USA had barely changed since WWII, despite significant economic growth (the so-called Easterlin Paradox). In a significant step forward for the field of wellbeing, Ed Diener and Daniel Kahneman (starting in the 1980s) showed that it was possible for wellbeing to be effectively measured and explained. Since then, psychologists and economists have made increasing use of subjective measures to investigate which experiences have the biggest effect on individual wellbeing.  The last few decades have seen an explosion of research on subjective wellbeing (SWB) with over 170,000 books and articles published in the last 15 years (see figure below). Policymakers are starting to take note too. The UK government has been measuring SWB for over a decade and, in 2013, the OECD suggested that its member-states should do the same. In 2019, New Zealand became the first country to introduce a Wellbeing Budget and joined Finland, Iceland, Scotland, and Wales to form the Wellbeing Economy Governments partnership.  Learn more: Trends in conceptions of progress and well-being If subjective wellbeing measures have only come into use in recent decades, how have researchers and policymakers been measuring progress up to now? When a direct measure is unavailable, a ‘proxy measure’, one you think is a suitable stand-in, might be used instead. It is common to use income metrics (e.g. GDP per capita) or health metrics (e.g. quality-adjusted life years) as proxies for wellbeing but these suffer from a number of problems which we explain further in the following sections. Psychologists use the phrase ‘failures of affective forecasting’ to describe the mistakes we make when predicting how we, and others, will feel in the future (Gilbert & Wilson, 2007; Wilson & Gilbert, 2005; Wilson & Gilbert, 2003). We underestimate the suffering caused by problems that are resistant to hedonic adaptation (Greene, Sturm, & Evelo, 2016), as well as experiences where it is difficult to put ourselves in the shoes of others (Igou, 2008). Our mental simulations produce these errors because they are egocentric, neglect context, and poorly represent time. Mental illness and chronic pain are two of the biggest problems that are under-valued in this way (Birkjær, Kaats, & Rubio, 2020; Graham, Higuera, & Lora, 2011). Understanding the “expectation-reality gap”, the gap between what people think makes others happy and what actually does, can help us to identify and evaluate global priorities more effectively. As you’ll see in the chart from Our World in Data below, people across a range of cultures mistakenly believe that others are less happy than they really are.   Learn more: Our report on affective forecasting  As we saw in the introduction, a challenging problem arises when you are faced with a choice between two (or more) different methods for increasing wellbeing. How much ‘moral weight’ should we give to saving a life, compared to increasing income, or treating someone for depression? Many people think it is too simplistic to reduce wellbeing to a single measure so they combine metrics for income, life expectancy, literacy, and many other things into a multi-dimensional index. However, each item on the list needs to be given an appropriate weighting which means that the difficult questions about trade-offs must still be faced. However, there is a solution to this problem. By measuring subjective wellbeing, we can directly compare the impact of different interventions on the wellbeing of the recipients rather than making an educated guess about their relative impact.  Learn more: Estimating moral weights using subjective wellbeing  GDP has been a common measure of national progress since the 1950s. However, the Easterlin Paradox (Easterlin, 1974) notes that average life satisfaction in the developed world has remained broadly stable over the last few decades despite a continuous rise in GDP per capita. This can be clearly seen in the charts below which plot life satisfaction (the white dots) against GDP per capita (the red line) in four high-income countries over recent decades.   This finding directly contradicts the evidence that richer countries are more satisfied than poorer countries and that richer people within countries are more satisfied than poorer people. The explanation lies in the fact that your wellbeing is not solely dependent on your own income, it is also affected by your relative income compared to your peers. For example, if you are wealthier than your peers then you should expect to have higher wellbeing. However, if your income rises, but the income of your peers also rises, these effects are cancelled out, leaving your wellbeing unchanged. Learn more: Will faster economic growth make us happier? Economists often use health metrics such as the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) or the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as a proxy for the quality of people’s lives. These are based on questions about time trade-offs, in which people are asked how many years of healthy life they would give up to avoid living with different health conditions. However, neither measure is an accurate guide to what makes people happy or satisfied because they are based on predictions of the badness of different health conditions rather than lived experience of those conditions.  If we only rely on guesses about future feelings, then we get the wrong answers about the effects of different health conditions on subjective wellbeing. For example, DALY estimates suggest that many people think that having depression would be about as bad as walking with a slight limp and they would trade off similar amounts of time to avoid either situation. However, data from people who actually live with these conditions shows that the effect of ‘moderate anxiety or depression’ is associted with a ten times greater change in subjective wellbeing than ‘some mobility issues’ (Dolan and Metcalfe, 2012).  Thankfully, there is a better solution. The ‘wellbeing-adjusted life year’ (WELLBY) allows us to compare different outcomes in a common currency (Frijters et al. 2020). One way, but not the only way, to specify the WELLBY is to say 1 WELLBY is equivalent to increasing life satisfaction for one person, by one point, for a year. This method is structurally similar to D/QALYs in that it seeks to combine quality and quantity of life. The main difference is that WELLBYs are based on direct reports of subjective experience, whereas D/QALYs are based on error-prone predictions of wellbeing in different scenarios. Also, note that D/QALYs are measured on a 0-1 scale whereas WELLBYs are based on a 0-10 scale. Learn more: Using WELLBYs to estimate the moral weights of doubling consumption and averting the death of a child  As the previous sections have shown, research into the best ways to increase global wellbeing has barely begun. At HLI, we aim to find the most cost-effective, well-evidenced ways to improve subjective wellbeing and then communicate those to key decision-makers, such as philanthropists and policymakers, who can provide the resources to scale them up.  Our charity evaluation process starts with the expectation that donations will go furthest when helping those in extreme poverty, but we are confident of finding other funding opportunities that are even more impactful (see Section 5.2). So far, we’ve evaluated two well-evidenced interventions: ​cash transfers and psychotherapy. A large number of academic studies show that cash transfers are a very effective way to reduce poverty and the strength of this evidence led GiveWell to recommend GiveDirectly as one of their top charities. However, we believed that providing group psychotherapy for people with depression in low-income countries could be even more cost-effective than cash transfers. After a rigorous search, we identified StrongMinds as one of the best charities delivering this intervention. We estimate that GiveDirectly produces 8 (95% CI: 1, 32) WELLBYs per $1,000, based on 35 studies and 92,963 participants. We estimate that StrongMinds produces 30 (95% CI: 15, 75) WELLBYs, based on 74 studies and 28,491 participants. Therefore, we find that StrongMinds is 3.7 times more cost-effective than GiveDirectly. This is a surprising and important result. We’ve demonstrated that it’s possible to compare seemingly incomparable outcomes by measuring their effects in terms of subjective wellbeing. By doing so, we found a new and outstanding funding opportunity for philanthropists and policymakers. This provides further evidence that we shouldn’t rely on our intuitions about what makes people happier and should prioritise further research on the best ways to measure and increase global wellbeing.  We’re excited to explore other promising opportunities to improve subjective wellbeing on a larger scale. In this section, we set out the empirical and theoretical questions where further research could be most impactful. Learn more: read our research agenda  We plan to examine interventions at three levels of scale: In order to assess the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in terms of subjective wellbeing, we need data. Thankfully, there is now plenty of data available on the effect of certain interventions on the happiness, life satisfaction, and mental health of recipients. However, cost-effectiveness evaluations are sensitive to a number of other important factors for which the data is more limited and our modelling is more uncertain. These include the costs to deliver interventions, the effects of the interventions over time (which requires multiple, long-term follow-ups), the effects on other household members, and the household size. Interventions provided to an individual often have ‘spillover’ benefits for other members of their household too. These spillover effects may even be greater than the direct benefit to the recipient. For example, in a household of four, if one member receives an intervention that improves their wellbeing it would only require a spillover effect of 33% for the household effect to be more important. If more data was collected, uncertainty in our cost-effectiveness analyses would be reduced and resource allocation would be more accurate. Learn more: household spillovers for cash transfers and psychotherapy  Even with valid measures and sufficient data, identifying the best way to help others also involves some uncomfortable philosophical dilemmas and theoretical questions. One particularly pressing problem is defining the ‘neutral point’, the point where someone is neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. If someone reports their life satisfaction score is 6/10 (on a 0-10 scale) is it better to: (a) extend their life for one year, or (b) improve their life satisfaction by one unit for two years? If the neutral point is 5/10, then (a) gives them one extra unit of wellbeing and (b) gives them two. However, if the neutral point is 0/10, (a) gives them six units and (b) gives them two. Hence, defining the neutral point is key to decisions about whether to extend or improve a life. It is not clear where the neutral point is and there has been little discussion of how to determine this. Researchers sometimes treat the midpoint of subjective wellbeing scales (5/10) as the point where someone is neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, or neither happy nor unhappy. But if we take this as the neutral point, this has the controversial implication that many people, particularly those in low-income countries, have lives that are net negative (if we only consider their wellbeing). Other researchers treat the bottom of the scale (0/10) as the neutral point but this has a different, but also controversial, implication that it is impossible for anyone to have a life that is net negative.  Learn more: a philosophical review of Open Philanthropy’s Cause Prioritisation Framework Coming soon: a working paper on defining the neutral point There are many ways to increase the wellbeing of others through your career and/or donations. In this section, we highlight the most promising opportunities for impact. There are many organisations doing a tremendous amount of good to improve wellbeing in the world. You can make an exceptional difference to the lives of others by donating thoughtfully to the most cost-effective and evidence-based charities. In addition to supporting our recommended charities, you can also fund further research by making a tax-deductible donation to the Happier Lives Institute. One of the biggest challenges to increasing global wellbeing is establishing a strong evidence base of cost-effective interventions. Governments are understandably reticent to scale up unproven interventions, but promising interventions can only prove their value if they receive sufficient funding. Therefore, philanthropists and grantmakers have a vital role to play in supporting innovation and research. Learn more: our latest advice for donors There are many potentially valuable research directions including: identifying the root causes of mental illnesses; improving preventive interventions; advancing the scale-up of existing treatments; and developing new treatments or improving existing ones e.g. psychedelic-assisted mental health treatments If you’re a researcher that conducts studies to determine the effects of an intervention, please make sure you collect data on subjective wellbeing. And not just for the recipient; the effects on other members of the household can be just as significant. In order to conduct an accurate cost-effectiveness evaluation, it’s also important to measure the effects over time so plan to conduct follow-up surveys to determine how long the effects last. Learn more: what are the most pressing research questions?  Non-profit organisations serve a very valuable role, particularly in low-income settings where governance is weak, such as conflict-affected regions (where the prevalence of mental disorders is exceptionally high) or in locations where the local government has no reach, such as rural or remote areas. NGOs can also be innovative in ways that governments are less likely to be, for example by finding new ways to improve effectiveness or lower costs and may be able to encourage governments to scale-up services. For example, Sangath has worked with state governments in India to train community health workers to deliver low-cost mental health interventions at scale. Given the size of the treatment gap and the scope for innovation, we’re excited to see new non-profits being set up to experiment with different delivery methods. Charity Entrepreneurship, a non-profit incubator, provides training and guidance to those wishing to start new charities. In 2020, they conducted a detailed search for interventions that improve mental health and subjective welľbeing. Tech entrepreneurship also seems very promising. Examples include Headspace (a meditation app), Happify (happiness-training exercises), MindEase (anxiety relief), UpLift (CBT for depression), and Sanvello (a support platform for mental health). Digital mental health is still in its infancy. However, if effective and commercially viable products can be delivered at scale, it would make an enormous dent in the burden of global mental illness. Advocates can raise awareness of neglected global priorities like mental health and press policymakers to provide more and better services. This could include campaigning, journalism, lobbying, or work in think tanks at a national or international level. Even those engaged in research and intervention delivery can undertake advocacy work alongside their other activities.  A key role that advocates can play is bringing together diverse actors and stakeholders. Different groups, such as clinicians, civil society, and economists, take different approaches to advocacy which can result in them passing contradictory messages to decision-makers. Improvements in advocacy could involve greater coordination of these messages, clearer communication to decision-makers, and better use of evidence of the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in low-income countries to inform decision-makers. There are tremendous opportunities for policymakers that wish to increase the wellbeing of their populations as cost-effectively as possible. Where funding and political will exists, they can scale up the evidence-based interventions developed and tested by researchers and non-profits. And even if no additional funding is available, there are likely to be many ways to use existing budgets more effectively, such as shifting mental health expenditure from psychiatric hospitals to community-based services.

      " Coming up with a formal definition of happiness can be tricky. After all, shouldn’t we just know it when we feel it? In fact, we often use the term to describe a range of positive emotions, including amusement, joy, pride, and contentment. But to understand the causes and effects of happiness, researchers first need to define it. For most, the term happiness is interchangeable with “subjective well-being,” which is typically measured by asking people about how satisfied they feel with their lives (evaluative), how much positive and negative emotion they tend to feel (affective), and their sense of meaning and purpose (eudaimonic). In her 2007 book The How of Happiness, positive psychology researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky elaborates, describing happiness as “the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one’s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.” However, it’s important to note that social and cultural factors also influence how we think about happiness. For example, studies by William Tov and others have found that people from cultures that embrace more collectivist ideals think about happiness more in terms of harmony and contentment, while more individualistic-minded people connect it to feelings of exuberance and joy. Happiness levels are also shaped by social groups, like families; happier people increase the happiness of people around them.  Though people around the world have different ways of thinking about happiness and perhaps even experience it in different ways, most involve feeling positive generally and about life overall. Can feeling good ever be bad?

What does the island reveal about the science of happiness? Many studies have found that happiness actually improves other aspects of our lives. Here is an overview of some of the good stuff that research has linked to happiness. Of course, there will be times in life when happiness feels out of reach. That’s OK. Our unpleasant emotions are appropriate responses to difficult situations; they’re there to guide our responses and help us make meaning from challenges and adversity. Indeed, there is a great deal of research suggesting that trying to feel or falsely express happiness in bad situations is harmful to mental and physical health—and that striving to feel constantly happy can actually diminish your overall happiness in life. Multiple studies suggest that experiencing and embracing a range of emotions, not just the positive ones, is good for our mental and physical health. It’s also important to note that injury and illness can make happiness harder to achieve. For example, concussions and long COVID are both associated with depression. In short, happiness in life is a worthy aspiration, and there are benefits to feeling happy—but it’s not realistic or healthy to expect a constant stream of positive emotions. When you do feel unhappy, it’s important to listen to that signal. Perhaps it’s time to change what you’re doing or thinking, seek support from a friend or therapist, or work to address a challenge you are facing. During especially hard times in life, suggests the research, you might look for meaning or psychological richness in your experiences, instead of trying to force yourself to be happier.  “Aim for noticing how you really feel right at that moment—and embrace all your diverse feelings,” suggests James Baraz. This will pave the way to happiness down the line. This month, play and find joy.  Young people used to be reliably happier than other age groups—but today, in certain regions of the world, they are struggling. Why don't you have enough free time? A historian looks at how work and leisure time have changed over the past century. We interviewed Black people about where happiness comes from and whether 15 typical happiness practices work for them. What can African American history tell us about the cultivation of well-being? What does the island reveal about the science of happiness? Our happiness is shaped by genetics, life experience, social forces,  and culture, as well as individual choices. While your control over most of those domains is limited, there are steps you can take on a personal level to increase your chances of experiencing happiness in life. And all of us can act to change culture and address inequalities that affect happiness on a collective level. Here are some of the keys to happiness identified by researchers, along with some specific, science-based activities for strengthening skills of happiness, in ourselves and in society. Build relationships: Perhaps the dominant finding from happiness research is that social connections are fundamental. Try these practices to strengthen trust, mutual support, and affection in your relationships: Practice different kinds of appreciation. Life can be hard, because negative events and emotions are inevitable. But we can bolster our resilience by shining the light of our attention on the good things. Pay attention. Studies find that people who practice mindfulness—the moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, and external circumstances—score higher on measures of happiness, and lower on measures of anxiety and distress. Practice kindness. Researchers believe generosity feels good because it highlights and incentivizes positive social interactions and strengthens the social bonds that support happiness. Here are some ways to be kind. Move your body—and then rest. Exercise isn’t just good for our bodies; it’s good for our happiness. So is sleep! Address inequalities. More egalitarian countries consistently rank among the happiest in the world—and there is evidence that economic, racial, and gender inequality hurts the happiness of disadvantaged groups. Fortunately, there are steps we can take to address these inequalities. Of course, happiness-boosting activities don’t work equally well for everyone. Understanding yourself better can help you choose practices and exercises that align with your personality, your situation, and your goals. This month, play and find joy.

Revisiting everyday experiences can bring you more joy than you might expect.  Accepting difficult feelings like anger or irritation can help us keep our cool, feel better overall, and find calm on the other side.

If you have a lot of stress in your life, find ways to reduce it, such as learning a few time-management techniques. Introduce regular exercise and time to yourself. These are positive changes. Taking control of your time in this way can effectively reduce stress. If you have feelings of anxiety along with your stress, breathing techniques can help. Try this breathing exercise for stress. Read more about managing stress and building resilience on the Mind website You can also try some practical self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques on the Every Mind Matters website to help manage stress and anxiety, solve problems and build resilience. Doing things that you enjoy is good for your emotional wellbeing. Simple activities like watching sports with a friend, having a soak in the bath, or meeting up with friends for coffee can all improve your day. Doing something you're good at, such as cooking or dancing, is a good way to enjoy yourself and have a sense of achievement. Try to avoid things that seem enjoyable at the time but make you feel worse afterwards, such as drinking too much alcohol or eating junk food. Self-esteem is the way you feel about yourself. The best way to improve your self-esteem is to treat yourself as you'd treat a valued friend, in a positive but honest way. Notice when you're putting yourself down, such as thinking, \"You're so stupid for not getting that job\", and instead think, \"Would I say that to my best friend?\". You probably wouldn't. Tell yourself something positive instead, such as: \"You're a bright person, you'll get the next job\". When times are hard, it's tempting to drink alcohol because it \"numbs\" painful feelings. But it can exaggerate some feelings and make you feel angry or aggressive. It can also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol Making healthy choices about your diet can make you feel emotionally stronger. You're doing something positive for yourself, which lifts your self-esteem. A good diet helps your brain and body work efficiently, too. Aim to eat a balanced diet that includes all the main food groups. Even moderate exercise releases chemicals in your brain that lift your mood. It can help you sleep better, have more energy and keep your heart healthy. Choose an exercise that you enjoy. If it helps, do it with a friend or listen to music. Adults should aim for at least 150 minutes a week. Read about exercise for depression Around 7 to 8 hours is the average amount of sleep an adult needs for their body and mind to fully rest. Writing a \"to do\" list for the next day before bed can organise your thoughts and clear your mind of any distractions. Communication is important, whether it's with a friend, family member or counsellor.  Talking things through helps you to release tension, rather than keeping it inside. It helps strengthen your relationships and connect with people. Lots of people find talking to a counsellor about things that are troubling them very helpful. See NHS talking therapies and benefits of talking therapy for more information. Find out more about depression support groups Resilience is what allows you to cope with life's ups and downs. Making something worthwhile out of painful times helps your resilience grow. Starting a support group to help others, or making something creative out of bad experiences by, for example, writing, painting or singing, can help you express pain and get through hard times.

      "What leads to happiness? The 2022 World Happiness Report (WHR) identified Finland as the happiest country. The United States slotted in at No. 16 — not bad when you consider the report ranked 146 countries. Every year, lists like the WHR attempt to measure and quantify happiness. (It’s a collaborative effort of universities, research groups, and Gallup World Poll data.) But this task is easier said than done. What makes a country and its people happy? Is it their overall sense of well-being? Or their daily experiences of positive emotions like laughter or enjoyment? The WHR relies on these and many other measures to assemble its list, and its authors acknowledge that even defining the word “happiness” can be tricky. Psychologists who study happiness agree. “When we ask people what it means to be happy, we get a huge variety of responses,” says Iris Mauss, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of California in Berkeley. “A lot of people say happiness means having positive feelings, but then if we ask them what feelings specifically, some say it means to be excited and others say it means to be peaceful.” Other people, she says, don’t talk about emotions at all. They say that happiness is knowing that their life is better now than it was in the past or that their life has meaning and purpose. Dr. Mauss and her colleagues have also found that people from different cultures sometimes define happiness in starkly different ways. Happiness, in other words, is a slippery concept to get a handle on. But there is some consistency in the ways that experts define and evaluate it. And their work has found that greater happiness is both achievable and associated with a range of health benefits. The American Psychological Association (APA) defines happiness as “an emotion of joy, gladness, satisfaction, and well-being.” Many of us would agree with the APA’s definition, yet the more you look at it, the more it can seem incomplete. For example, you may feel all of those emotions at one moment, but an hour later you may feel none of them. So are you a happy person or not? “When people talk about happiness, they’re usually talking about their overall well-being,” says Robin Stern, PhD, a psychoanalyst and the associate director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence in New Haven, Connecticut. Emotions like joy and excitement can contribute to well-being, she says, but so do broader feelings of fulfillment, contentment, and achievement. If you read through the published research on happiness, you find that most of it actually focuses on well-being. And experts who study well-being often break down that concept into two categories: hedonia and eudaimonia. “Hedonic well-being focuses on feelings of positive affect and life satisfaction,” according to the authors of a study published in 2021 in Psychological Review (PDF). “Eudaimonic well-being focuses on a sense of optimal functioning and realizing potential.” Any complete definition of happiness probably needs to acknowledge both sides of the well-being coin. As the APA’s definition makes plain, happiness can mean a lot of things. Pleasure, joy, excitement, contentment, and satisfaction could all be considered types or shades of happiness. But so could deeper senses of contentment or life satisfaction, Dr. Stern says. Apart from these distinctions, researchers have also found that people in different parts of the world may define happiness in different ways. “Cross-culturally, there are differences in how people think about happiness,” Mauss says. “In the West, we tend to understand happiness as more of an individualistic state, but in some East Asian cultures, it’s more a social concern.” For example, an American may define happiness in terms of their own feelings or successes. But some of Mauss’ research shows that people in many East Asian cultures think of happiness as a state of social harmony, family connectedness, and community well-being. In other words, some people’s idea of happiness is less about personal joy or achievement and more strongly associated with community cohesion and harmony. Interestingly, more of her research has found that when people in the United States and other Western nations place a high value on being happy, this emphasis is associated with higher rates of depression symptoms and diagnoses. While being happy is great, her work suggests that actively trying to be happier can backfire. (More on what psychologists say actually works to boost happiness below.) Going back to the APA’s definition, happiness is associated with feelings like joy, gladness, satisfaction, and well-being. Other researchers have found that, at least in the United States, many people say that happiness involves no negative feelings. (In most other countries, people don’t see happiness as a total absence of negative feelings.) According to a study published in Frontiers in Psychology, feelings of inner harmony, meaning, and positive emotions also describe what happiness feels like. “Happier people are healthier.” That’s according to the authors of a study published in 2020 in Psychological Science. Like most of the research on happiness, that study defines happiness in terms of subjective well-being. Researchers asked participants questions about how they feel and used the answers to determine their well-being. The authors say that there’s ample evidence linking higher levels of subjective well-being to health benefits. Some of those research-backed health benefits include: How could subjective well-being contribute to all these health benefits? A lot of research, including the aforementioned paper linking happiness to lower stress and anxiety, points to the effect of well-being on the body’s nervous system. Specifically, elevated levels of well-being are associated with less activation of the body’s sympathetic nervous system, also known as the fight-or-flight system. Happiness and positive attitudes toward life may prevent activation of physiological reactions to some life events that could otherwise have cumulative detrimental effects on health, researchers explained in the Social Science & Medicine paper. That study cites reduced activation of the automatic nervous system, which includes the fight-or-flight response, as one of the likeliest benefits of improved well-being. While there’s ample evidence linking happiness and well-being with health benefits, it’s less clear if becoming happier will make you healthier. Some research, including the 2020 Psychological Science paper, has found that when people improved their well-being, they experienced fewer sick days. “This work provides some evidence for a causal effect of subjective well-being on self-reported physical health,” according to the authors. Can you be too happy? Not really. If you feel good, that’s a good thing. However, psychologists have begun to examine a concept called “toxic positivity,” which researchers at the University of Winnipeg in Canada have described as a tendency to “reject, deny, or displace” any negative feelings or experiences in an attempt to see the world through rose-colored glasses. It’s trying to force happiness or positivity when neither is naturally present that can backfire. “To think that on a gray day, with a backdrop of a recent death in the family, or stress at work, or illness, or other bad news, that you should feel positive or happy, that’s not realistic or even healthy,” Stern says. While we may regard some feelings as negative or difficult, they are still normal and healthy aspects of emotional experience, she says. They can also be valuable pieces of feedback. “If you feel afraid or upset or anxious because of an unhealthy relationship or work environment, those feelings are information that can help you make decisions,” she says. They may help lead you to make positive, constructive changes in your life. Many books, blogs, articles, and motivational speakers have attempted to answer this question. The list of things you could do to boost your happiness and well-being is long, and the specifics are in large part determined by your individual preferences and goals. But here are some do's and don’ts supported by both experts and newer research. Recent research (PDF) suggests that “psychological richness” may be a major component of well-being. “We define psychological richness as a life full of interesting and perspective-changing experiences,” says Shigehiro Oishi, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago and coauthor of that research. “Novel activities, games, sports, and arts help us deal with boredom inherent in life,” he adds. New experiences also foster curiosity, which research shows is a major contributor to well-being. Likewise, a lot of research has linked strong social relationships to improved happiness and well-being. “Close relationships and warm connections with other people are one of the biggest elements of happiness,” Stern says. “If work or personal achievement or improvement are the only things in your life, you may be missing a big piece of what makes us humans happy or content.” She says that when most people recall their happiest moments, most of those memories are centered around social connections and relationships, not solitary pursuits. According to a review published in 2021, there’s strong evidence linking feelings of gratitude to higher levels of happiness and well-being. Studies have also found that cultivating gratitude can actually boost happiness. “Gratitude is our best weapon — an ally to counter these internal and external threats that rob us of sustainable joy,” says Robert Emmons, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of California in Davis. He says that making an effort to tell the people in your life that you’re grateful for them — and why — is one way to cultivate gratitude. Another is taking time each day to think about the things you are grateful for. Some of Dr. Emmons' work has found that keeping a daily journal in which you write what you’re grateful for can also lead to greater levels of positivity (Stern was a coauthor). Mindfulness comes up so often these days that it almost feels like a cliche. But research continues to find that practicing mindfulness really can improve well-being. “Mindfulness-based practices have broadly been found to have several benefits including, but not limited to, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as enhancing attentional focus, working memory capacity, cognitive flexibility, positive mood, resilience, immune functioning, interpersonal relationships, and well-being,” per the authors of a study published in 2020 in Frontiers in Psychology. Their work found that just three minutes of daily practice may be enough to improve measures of well-being. Another important point: For these changes to work, your heart has to be in it. “There are no shoulds with emotions,” Stern says. “It’s all about if you want to.” She has helped develop an app called Mood Meter that encourages users to regularly note how they’re feeling by marking their emotion on a color-coded axis. “If you are using the app regularly, you will start to notice patterns,” she says. “That information is useful and, for many, surprising.” It may help you identify times or activities that sour your mood, as well as those that tend to make you happier. Happiness is a wonderful thing. We all deserve plenty of it in our lives. But there’s a lot more to it than feeling positive emotions like joy or elation.

      "Feeling like bouncing off the walls? Here’s what’s going on inside your body. Oh, joy! That happy, buoyant emotion is a great feeling, whether it’s brought on by a big life event (like a wedding or birth) or something as simple as finding the perfect fruit at the farmer’s market. On an emotional level, we may feel joy in a variety of ways — tearfully, euphoric, with a deep sense of contentment, and more. On a scientific level, we feel joy in our neurotransmitters, which are tiny chemical “messenger” cells that transmit signals between neurons (nerves) and other bodily cells. Those neurotransmitters are responsible for processes and feelings in almost every aspect of the body, from blood flow to digestion. Feeling joyful? Here are all the ways happiness runs throughout your body. Every emotion you feel is affected by your brain and vice versa. According to Diana Samuel, MD, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, “The brain does not have a single emotional center, but different emotions involve different structures.” For example, she explains, your frontal lobe (commonly known as the “control panel” of the brain) monitors your emotional state, while the thalamus (an information center that regulates consciousness) participates in how your emotional responses are executed. We feel joy in our bodies because of the release of dopamine and serotonin, two types of neurotransmitters in the brain. Both of these chemicals are heavily associated with happiness (in fact, people with clinical depression often have lower levels of serotonin). If you’re feeling down, simple activities like going for a walk in nature, petting a dog or cat, kissing a loved one, and yes, even forcing yourself to smile, can help those neurotransmitters do their job and raise your mood. So, when something you perceive as happy happens, your brain receives the signal to release these chemicals into your central nervous system (which consists of your brain and spinal cord). This then causes reactions in other bodily systems. Ever noticed that when you feel especially happy, your face flushes or your heart races? This is because of the effect on your circulatory system, explains Dr. Samuel: “Butterflies in your stomach, your facial expressions, even changes in your finger temperature… all of these can depend on your emotions. The effects on the circulatory system can present in different ways physically.” Your circulatory system consists of your heart, veins, blood vessels, blood, and lymph. Of course, joy isn’t the only emotion that affects this system — fear, sadness, and other emotions can cause reactions in these parts of the body as well. Your autonomic nervous system is the bodily system responsible for all the things your body does without conscious effort from you — like breathing, digestion, and dilation of the pupil. And yes, it’s also affected by feelings of joy and elation. For example, your breathing can pick up when you’re doing something particularly fun (like riding a roller coaster) or slow down when you’re participating in a more relaxing pleasurable activity (like walking in the forest). “Smiling can trick your brain by elevating your mood, lowering your heart rate, and reducing your stress. The smile doesn’t have to be based on real emotion because faking it works as well.” — Dr. Samuel It’s well-known that your pupils dilate when you’re sexually aroused, but they can also grow or shrink based on other emotional states, too. Other autonomic aspects that can be affected by pleasure include salivation, sweating, body temperature, and even metabolism. Any type of emotional arousal can also affect your smooth muscles, says Dr. Samuel, which are located in the walls of your hollow organs (like your stomach, intestines, and bladder). These involuntary muscles are responsible for things like blood flow and the movement of food through your digestive tract — so that could be a reason why your appetite revs up or slows down when you’re feeling positive emotions. It’s hard to say which comes first because your feelings and your physiology are inextricably linked. Dr. Samuel says, “When something joyous happens, the emotional and physical response occurs right away because all of these things are happening simultaneously in the body.” And don’t worry — it’s normal to experience varying physical sensations in reaction to your happy emotions and to have different bodily responses than those around you. You may literally get the urge to jump for joy, while your friend or sibling is more of the happy-crying type. “Exercise can also take your mind off worries and negative thoughts that may feed depression and anxiety.” — Dr. Samuel In a way, you can, says Dr. Samuel. Even just the simple act of smiling can help. She explains, “Smiling can trick your brain by elevating your mood, lowering your heart rate, and reducing your stress. The smiledoesn’t have to be based on real emotion because faking it works as well.” Another way to use your physiology to enhance your emotional state? Exercise (yes, even when you don’t feel like doing it). Samuel says that exercise “can help ease depression and anxiety by releasing feel good endorphins and other natural brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that enhance your sense of well-being. Exercise can also take your mind off worries and negative thoughts that may feed depression and anxiety.” If you’re feeling down, simple activities like going for a walk in nature, petting a dog or cat, kissing a loved one, and yes, even forcing yourself to smile, can help those neurotransmitters do their job and lift your mood. Now that you know how your body and your emotions can work in tandem, it may be a little easier to “hack” your mood so that you feel more joyful on a daily basis.

      "Joy involves changing the way we engage in the world. Colors seem brighter, physical movements feel freer and easier, and smiling happens involuntarily. We even experience changes in our thinking and attention, which opens us up to creativity and the ability to solve complex problems. In other words, joy feels bright and light. We have a playful orientation to the world, even in our work. We feel we can do anything. Many researchers suggest that joy resembles Maslow’s 1964 concept of peak experience. Want more tips to live better? Check out Saundra’s latest book here. Social Connectedness  A 2012 study examined peak experiences by asking middle-aged Americans to reflect on a recent joyful experience. The researchers found that joy was most experienced with loved ones, concluding that joy is most often experienced socially (Hoffman et al., 2012). This finding is consistent with other studies that show that being in the company of loved ones creates an environment of emotional safety, enabling feelings of freedom and playfulness. This finding was also seen during the pandemic, where older adults reported that family and friends were the most frequently reported source of joy (Whitehead & Torossian, 2021). Object of Joy Most research on joy concludes that the object of joy is always personally meaningful and important to the individual (Chauhan et al., 2020). In other words, the experience of joy relies greatly upon the subjective individual interpretation. Furthermore, studies show that feelings of joy are sometimes short-lived, such as seeing your favorite performer or spending time with friends. Other experiences of joy were long-lasting, such as changing careers or giving birth. When the object of joy was short-lived, people described joy as an intense and consuming feeling of positivity. In those moments of joy, any unpleasantness or worry disappeared. Similarly, when the object of joy was long-lived, people described an intense feeling of positivity, but these experiences differed in that joy was directed toward hopefulness for the future, instead of being solely focused on positive feelings of the moment (Chauhan et al., 2020). Willful Loss of Control Most studies show that experiences of joy also heightened awareness and fulfillment, and often is accompanied by spontaneous playful movement such laughing, dancing, and/or clapping (Chauhan et al., 2020; Cottrell, 2016). Even if people aren’t jumping, clapping, or tapping a foot, people report that they feel animated and lively. People also describe experiencing an all-encompassing feeling of positivity and goodness, with a profound sense of freedom. When joy was long-lasting, people described a willful loss of control, which is often described as a sense of going with the flow and trusting the nature of what happens in their lives (Chauhan et al., 2020). In these cases, the desire to move freely was about letting go of worries, allowing themselves to be open to opportunities. Over the next week, consider these three questions: Were there times this week, because of feelings of joy, that I felt time seemed to fly by? What was the object of your joy? Did something happen this week that made me feel like celebrating? Did my life go well this week? If so, why? As you consider these questions, please accept that there is no, one right answer to these questions. Our lives are constantly changing. These questions are primarily intended to help you become aware of the joy that fills our everyday lives. References Chauhan, P. H., Leeming, D., & King, N. (2020).

      " Our cats love my partner. When presented with two laps, the cats will choose hers, almost every time. In the morning, our kitten Leif nurses on her shoulder, his little paws making biscuits. Am I jealous? Nope. I feel really happy seeing a woman I love being adored by cats I love.  Scientists have a name for this feeling, which they borrowed from the Buddhist ethic of Muditā: sympathetic joy, which is sometimes called appreciative joy, empathic joy, vicarious reward, or (more broadly) positive empathy. By whatever name, it’s the unadulterated goodness we feel when something good happens for someone else.  That sounds great, but there are times when it can be hard to feel sympathetic joy, yes? Especially if we’re feeling personally threatened or unhappy with our own lives. There are many unpleasant emotions that can diminish the opportunity to share in other people’s joy: fear, jealousy, envy, stress, and resentment, among others. Even if we do experience sympathetic joy with most people most of the time, there will still be times when we just want that warm fluffy cat on our own laps instead of someone else’s, or fall into despair over why the cat (or our boss, or the world) doesn’t like us as much. Research is starting to document why sympathetic joy happens and when it doesn’t. It’s discovering as well why sympathetic joy is good for us and good for the people around us—and how we can cultivate more of it in our lives. Here’s a rundown of what the research so far suggests. Sympathetic joy might sound noble, but what’s in it for you?  I’m kidding, sort of—in fact, there are benefits for the person who can connect with another’s joy. Several studies show how witnessing another’s good fortune can activate the brain’s reward system. Beyond just feeling good, the ability to feel sympathetic joy has been linked to greater life satisfaction and happiness. More sympathetic joy might also help make us a more compassionate society. More and more studies are finding a link with sympathetic joy and our willingness to help other people—and the likelihood we’ll actually do it. Sympathetic joy also seems to result in better personal relationships. A 2018 paper found that “although having a partner who empathizes with one’s negative emotions is good for relationships, having a partner who (also) empathizes with one’s positive emotions may carry even greater benefits,” as the authors write. Polyamorous people—those who have multiple romantic relationships with the consent of all involved—have a name for the happiness of seeing your partner experience pleasure or fall in love with someone else: compersion. A 2013 study of just over 300 polyamorous people found that the more they experienced this species of sympathetic joy, the more satisfied they were with their relationships—a result echoed by two other studies published last year in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, one of which involved 5,000 people. Do you notice joy in others and share in their happiness? Sympathetic joy may also result in better outcomes on the job. One 2016 study measured sympathetic joy in over 1,200 predominantly white teachers who mainly taught students of color. The teachers who were more likely to take joy in their students’ good experiences felt more connected to them—and the students had higher academic achievement. Another study of teachers and frontline health care workers found that those who experienced more sympathetic joy on the job showed less burnout and higher satisfaction at work.  This is a good place to mention that there are many unanswered questions about sympathetic joy. Most of the studies I read were conducted with young people in China or the United States. So, what does sympathetic joy look like elsewhere in the world? How does culture shape it? Does sympathetic joy have a developmental arc, rising and falling over the course of our lives?  While we may not yet have good answers to those questions, neuroscience is starting to map what path sympathetic joy takes through our bodies. In recent years, scientists have tried to figure out if sympathetic joy looks different from other kinds of connection in the human brain, such as when we become distressed by other people’s pain. The answers are revealing why sympathetic joy is so powerful. We’ll start with the overlap. For example, studies from the early 2000s show that empathy for other people’s good and bad feelings both activate the medial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which are associated with identifying, and assessing the significance of, our own and others’ mental states. Similarly, good feelings in ourselves and the good ones we perceive in other people both engage the nucleus accumbens (which signals pleasure) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (which supports learning to like whatever or whoever brings that pleasure).  So, given those similarities, what makes sympathetic joy distinct in the brain? A series of studies published during the past few years have shed more light on what makes it different from other kinds of resonance—and it seems to come down to a question of emphasis. One group of researchers slid study participants into functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machines as they watched an episode of “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition” (yes, this is funny) to try to measure their brain activity as they saw happy and sad scenes in the TV show. In fact, there were differences in brain response to positive and negative events on the screen, with empathic joy engaging frontostriatal circuitry more strongly. This neural pathway is thought to start in the prefrontal cortex, and it seems to support deliberate mental processes like regulating emotion, planning, and decision making. On the other hand, witnessing negative experiences provoked a stronger response in the insula, an area that signals visceral experiences like pain or present-moment awareness. That result is echoed by a 2021 study, which found that while all kinds of empathy activate frontostriatal circuitry, sympathetic joy triggers more activation, engaging “a much broader network of prefrontal subregions relative to empathy for negative emotion,” as the researchers write. Why do those findings matter for you and me? It suggests we tend to respond in a more straightforward way to people in trouble, in identifying their pain and even feeling it in ourselves. Sympathetic joy can involve more mental processes, like deciding what deserves our attention, and choosing how to interpret that information and how to respond to the situation. In other words, sympathetic joy may just have more moving parts. It can also be stymied by other feelings. Sometimes, it’s our anxieties that get in the way of our natural inclination to be sympathetically joyful. If a friend loses their job and you see their distress, it is very likely that you’ll feel genuine concern, which would automatically light up this brain circuitry. But if you kinda hate your own job and the same friend then gets a better one than yours…well, it’s entirely possible that those same prefrontal subregions won’t glow with happiness for them.  You can be forgiven for feeling envy instead of joy on their behalf; it’s pretty common. Indeed, a study published this year by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that social comparisons with people perceived as doing better than us were more likely to provoke envy and schadenfreude than sympathetic joy. There are quite a few studies showing that anxiety reduces empathy—and it seems sound to speculate that feeling anxious might affect your ability to feel sympathetic joy.   Differences with other people can also get in the way of feeling empathy for them, especially if the difference involves status and power. As people’s incomes rise, for example, empathy for those lower on the ladder tends to fall. Many, many studies show that we have a harder time feeling empathic concern for people in out-groups—racial, national, or otherwise. While there doesn’t seem to be much research on sympathetic joy toward people in out-groups, the studies to date do suggest that human differences would make it harder to feel.  For those reasons and more, there are times when it can be hard to feel sympathetic joy. I’m not always happy to see the cats purring on the lap of my partner. Sometimes I even think: Why do they prefer her to me when I’m the one who feeds them, dammit? It really isn’t fair, now that I’m thinking about it.  If you find self-pity, jealousy, or envy chasing away your sympathetic joy, remember that you can get it back with some intention and effort. Fortunately, sympathetic joy is like a muscle that you can build up with some mental exercise, just like any other feeling or behavior. You can start by taking our new quiz measuring your sympathetic joy—the results will not be scientific, though it is based on a validated scale developed mainly in China.  Finding out where you stand according to the quiz might help you to reflect on your capacity for feeling good with other people when they have a good experience—and it will give you a starting point for cultivating that ability. This will involve learning to better manage your own distress, reducing the compulsion to make comparisons, and strengthening your sense of common humanity with other people.  Here are some exercises researchers recommend for opening the door to positive empathy, most of which are borrowed from other articles in Greater Good or from our website of science-tested practices, Greater Good in Action. Watch a competition without taking sides. This suggestion comes from Kelly McGonigal in a 2017 article for Greater Good. “Appreciate the effort, skill, or artistry of all competitors—and celebrate the joy of whoever wins,” she writes. “Feel glad for their success, and watch how they celebrate it with others. See if you can extend your empathic joy to how they share the moment with friends, family, coaches, or teammates.” Capitalize on positive events. When people close to us—friends, family members, significant others—tell us about positive things that happened to them, these moments have the potential to make us feel significantly closer to one another—depending on how we respond. This activity offers tips for responding in a way that has been shown to nurture positive feelings on both sides of the relationship and to increase feelings of closeness and relationship satisfaction. Try to ease envy. Life is full of reminders of what we lack. In a 2013 article for Greater Good, psychologist Juliana Breines suggests five steps to reducing desire for what other people have, including naming envy and cultivating gratitude. Write a self-compassionate letter. Writing in a self-compassionate way can help you replace your self-critical voice with a more compassionate one—one that comforts and reassures you rather than berating you for your shortcomings. First, identify something about yourself that makes you feel ashamed, insecure, or not good enough. Write down how it makes you feel. Then try expressing compassion, understanding, and acceptance for the part of yourself that you dislike. Feeling more compassion for yourself can help open the door to feeling joy for the good things in the lives of other people. Try loving-kindness meditation. This meditation increases happiness in part by making you feel more connected to others—to loved ones, acquaintances, and even strangers. Research suggests that when people practice loving-kindness meditation regularly, they start automatically reacting more positively to others, and their social interactions and close relationships become more satisfying. Loving-kindness meditation can also reduce your focus on yourself—which can, in turn, help you to share in other people’s happiness. Try the common humanity meditation. Recognizing our common humanity means acknowledging that we are all humans, facing some of the same problems. We all experience suffering and stress, loss, and pain. We all want to be loved and experience contentment. Listen to this guided meditation created by Sean Fargo, a former Buddhist monk, to not only improve your relationship with yourself but also help build compassion for others. Try meeting someone’s gaze. A study published in 2021 by the journal NeuroImage found that deliberately locking eyes with another person can help you to feel genuinely happy for them when they share good news. This technique isn’t a slam dunk: Cultural differences and neurodivergence can affect the meaning and appropriateness of eye contact. That’s why it requires intention, effort, and good judgment. But while eye contact might feel sometimes risky, the reward could be a greater sense of connection and joy. Let someone do something nice for you. This is another one from Kelly McGonigal. “This might not seem like a practice of empathic joy, but it becomes one when you begin to pay attention to how happy it makes the other person,” she writes. “Sometimes our own discomfort with receiving kindness, or fear of being a burden to others, gets in the way of seeing that joy.” Jeremy Adam Smith edits the GGSC's online magazine, Greater Good. He is also the author or coeditor of five books, including The Daddy Shift, Are We Born Racist?, and (most recently) The Gratitude Project: How the Science of Thankfulness Can Rewire Our Brains for Resilience, Optimism, and the Greater Good. Before joining the GGSC, Jeremy was a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford University.  \n",

      "getting started Written By: DiveThru Team  Reviewed By: Natalie Asayag MSW, LCSW When we talk about our emotions, it seems like it’s usually the negative ones. That’s not a bad thing! It’s helpful to work through our tough feelings and let them all out as needed. But ya know what we should talk about more? Feeling joyful! All of the GOOD feelings, really. ‘Cause talking about how happy we are and how good we feel is severely underrated! Maybe we talk about it less because 1) we don’t wanna humble brag and 2) we can get into a habit of being fixers or problem solvers. We’re always trying to work our way “through” something, usually stress or anxiety about whatever is going on in our lives. And nobody’s looking for a cure for happiness… that would be ridiculous, right?! But we’re here to tell you that recognizing your happiness is super important. We should all be talking about our joy when we feel it! So let’s dive thru feeling joyful and how to embrace this all around happy emotion. To get more technical, what does it mean to feel joyful? APA Dictionary defines joy as: “n. a feeling of extreme gladness, delight, or exaltation of the spirit arising from a sense of well-being or satisfaction.” WOW. That’s quite a definition. But it’s pretty spot on, wouldn’t ya say? When we feel happiness, it can be from a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction with our lives. And that can look totally different for everyone! We might experience happiness from our job, or pursuing an education and continuing to learn. Our personal relationships with family, friends and romantic partners can bring us a lot of joy if the relationships are healthy and positive. Feeling cared for, loved, appreciated and recognized in all areas of our life can be so important for our mental wellbeing. A few simple ways to maintain more joy in our lives is to appreciate the moment and implement intrinsic motivation. For a lot of us, we might focus so much on the future and achieving milestones that we forget to appreciate the present and the little things that make us happy. This can cause us to feel more stress and anxiety in the long run. Intrinsic motivation allows us to pursue our goals and activities just because we enjoy them, without setting expectations for external awards. Take running for example. You don’t have to set goals for your runs, or train for a marathon if you don’t feel like it. Run simply because it’s something that makes you happy and feel good! No strings attached. Doing things that bring us happiness without a reward or punishment in mind can be a great shift in mindset. Your mental wellbeing improves significantly when you’re joyful. You’re probably thinking: nooo, ya don’t say?! But we’re here to shout it from the rooftops! ‘Cause joy is an underrated emotion and we need to talk about it more. Let’s look at all of the positive symptoms that feeling joyful provides for your mental health: When we feel joy, our brains release the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin throughout your body. Since your mind is so happy, it wants the rest of your body to feel good, too! Awww, isn’t that so sweet?! Did ya know that happiness has some great physical benefits too, not just mental? It’s true! When you feel joyful, your body reacts in positive ways. Here are a few physical symptoms you might experience when you’re jumping for joy: Clearly, joy is great for your overall health. Even when you’re feeling down, you can actually trick yourself into feeling happier. It might sound like B.S. but would we lie to you?! Try this out: whenever you’re feeling blue, try smiling or telling yourself a stupid joke that will make you laugh. Your mind perceives smiling as you feeling joy, even if it’s fake! Guess the saying “fake it til’ you make it” has some truth there. Now, how do we enjoy this good feeling while it lasts? We’ve got just the strategies for you! Try out some of these methods for yourself. They will bring a lil’ extra joy in your life, guaranteed! 1. Move Your Body We’ve got one word for you: endorphins. We know that exercise boosts endorphins, which make you happy! Even if physical activity isn’t your fave, there’s lots of fun ways to get active. Go for a walk, run, swim, bike, rock climbing, yoga, you name it. Dance around your room to a fun playlist like nobody’s watching, if that’s more your style! Whatever way you like, just get movin’. 2. Engage in Compassionate Self Talk Speaking to ourselves positively has been shown to improve our mental wellness. Does it feel silly and weird at first? Maybeee a bit. But it’s a great habit to start, so why not give it a shot? Tell yourself what you like about yourself, what you’re proud of and what makes you feel joy. You might surprise yourself! 3. Connect with a Friend Our true friends are there for us when we need them most by making our day a little brighter. So why not connect with a friend and pass on the good vibes you’re feeling?! Ask to go out for a coffee, a nice stroll in the park, or even FaceTime just to catch up. Spending time with our friends is a great way to maintain our good spirits! 4. Journal Try writing out exactly how you’re feeling and what made you feel this way. Can’t stop smiling because you received a nice compliment? Feel on top of the world thanks to your amazing test score? Expressing your feelings can give you clarity and feels really great, so jot it all down in detail! Your hand might start to cramp, but so what? Totally worth it. 5. Practice Gratitude Noticing the positives in life is great, and showing gratitude for them is even better! That might include writing a list of things that bring you joy, volunteering in your community, or showing acts of kindness to the people who make your life better. It honestly feels great for everyone involved, so why not try it out for yourself! Okay, you little ray of sunshine. That’s all we have for now! We hope this made your day even brighter, and that you radiate some of that good energy to the people around you. Chances are, they could use some joy, too!   Read More: \n",

      "ABOUT COACHING VIDEOS BOOKS ARTICLES LEARN More Joyfulness and happiness are two emotions often mentioned in the same breath, but they carry subtle differences in meaning and use.  Joyfulness: \"Joy\" is often used to describe a temporary, often immediate, state of delight or contentment. It can be elicited by a specific event, like receiving a compliment, hearing your favorite song, or achieving a small success. Joyfulness is typically fleeting and can fade quickly.  Happiness: \"Happy\" indicates a deeper and more prolonged feeling of contentment, peace, and well-being. It is not only linked to external events but also internal beliefs, values, and life circumstances. Happiness is often seen as a general assessment of one's life as a whole, rather than a response to a specific event.  Different cultures and languages have their own unique interpretations and nuances regarding these emotions:  Western Cultures: In many Western cultures, happiness is often linked with personal success, self-realization, and freedom. The individual pursuit of happiness is often seen as a right.  Eastern Cultures: In cultures like those of China and Japan, happiness might be more connected to harmony, balance, and community ties. Here, individual well-being might be seen as secondary to the well-being of the group or family.  Bhutan: This small Himalayan kingdom is renowned for its unique concept of \"Gross National Happiness\". Rather than focusing on economic growth, Bhutan gauges the well-being of its citizens based on several factors, including mental well-being, health, and community connectedness.  Scandinavian Countries: Often ranked among the happiest countries in the world, Scandinavian cultures emphasize social cohesion, well-being, and equality.  Overall, while the concepts of joyfulness and happiness are universal, how different cultures value, experience, and express these emotions can vary greatly.  Joyfulness is a positive emotion that, though pleasant, is often fleeting and momentary. It is characterized by a sudden burst of positivity, typically in response to external stimuli or events. Examples of everyday things that bring us joy:  Natural beauty: Seeing a sunset, flowers blooming, or listening to birds sing.  Human interactions: A kind greeting from a stranger, a compliment from a colleague, or a child's laughter.  Life's pleasures: Enjoying your favorite meal, reading a good book, or hearing your favorite song on the radio.  Small victories: Completing a task on your to-do list, achieving a personal goal, or receiving an unexpected bonus.  Surprises: Getting an unexpected gift, hearing good news, or experiencing an unexpected positive turn in your day.  While these moments can provide an immediate sense of delight and contentment, they are often short-lived. As time passes and the moment fades, the feeling of joy can wane, giving way to other emotions or everyday life.  The intensity and duration of joy can vary significantly based on external circumstances. For instance:  Environment: Your location, the weather, or the presence of certain people can influence how joyful you feel.  Personal state: Fatigue, stress, or other emotional states can influence the intensity of your joy.  Expectations and comparisons: If you have high expectations that are unmet, your joy might be shorter-lived. Similarly, comparing your situation to others can affect the intensity of your joy.  Joyfulness is a valuable and beautiful emotion, but it's also complex and can be heavily influenced by various external factors. While inherently transient, these moments of joy can enrich our lives and bring color to our daily routines.  Contrasting the fleeting delight and joyfulness from transient moments, profound happiness is a more stable and lasting state of well-being. It's a feeling often associated with a deep sense of contentment and a positive evaluation of life as a whole. Factors contributing to a profound sense of long-term happiness:  Purpose: Feeling that your life has meaning and purpose can form a strong foundation for lasting happiness. Purpose can stem from religion, spiritual beliefs, personal values, and pursuits of passions.  Meaningful relationships: Strong, healthy relationships with family, friends, and loved ones provide emotional support, security, and a sense of connection. This social connectedness is vital for our well-being.  Personal growth: Striving for self-improvement, learning, and growing, both mentally and emotionally, can contribute to a deeper sense of contentment. Overcoming challenges, learning new skills, and expanding your horizons all add to a sense of accomplishment and self-worth.  Recognition and appreciation: Feeling recognized and appreciated in your personal and professional life boosts self-confidence and self-worth, contributing to a deeper contentment.  Health and well-being: Physical health and mental well-being are fundamental pillars of profound happiness. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and mental care, such as meditation or therapy, all contribute to overall better well-being.  Profound happiness requires more than just fulfilling immediate needs and desires. It's about cultivating a life rich in purpose, surrounded by loving relationships, and ongoing personal development. By investing in these life aspects, we lay a foundation of well-being that is resilient to the inevitable challenges and changes that life brings.  Human behavior is often driven by the desire for immediate gratification and reward. This phenomenon, wherein we choose immediate benefits over long-term gains, can be explained by various psychological and sociological factors.  Evolutionary Biology: From an evolutionary perspective, the pursuit of immediate rewards makes sense. For our ancestors, for instance, it was more beneficial to consume readily available food than to wait, as the future was uncertain.  Dopamine and Reward Systems: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a central role in how we experience pleasure. Receiving an immediate reward, such as eating a sweet dessert or buying a new item, can cause an immediate dopamine release, leading to a feeling of pleasure.  Loss Aversion: People often fear loss more than they desire a gain of equivalent value. This might lead us to choose immediate rewards to avoid potential loss.  Instant Availability: Modern technology, from fast internet connections to on-demand services, has conditioned us to expect immediate gratification.  Advertising and Marketing: Advertisements capitalize on our desires and encourage us to buy, consume, and enjoy immediately. Brands often use powerful psychological triggers to increase the desire for their products.  Social Comparison: Social media has made it easier to compare ourselves with others. Seeing others enjoy immediate rewards and luxuries can drive us to seek the same.  Economic Structure: The consumer society is built on the idea of constant buying and consuming. This might emphasize short-term joys and immediate gratification over long-term investments in well-being and contentment.  People often opt for short-term joys due to both deeply ingrained psychological tendencies and influences from modern society. While these fleeting pleasures are enjoyable, it's also essential to recognize and pursue the significance of long-term well-being and deeper happiness.  In a world where immediate gratification is often emphasized, seeking sustainable, profound happiness is a worthy challenge. Sustainable happiness goes beyond the temporary joys of everyday life; it's a stable, long-term state of well-being and contentment. Here are some tips and strategies to pursue and maintain such happiness:  Self-reflection: Regularly take time to reflect on your life, your values, and your goals. This helps you recognize what truly matters to you and what makes you happy in the long run.  Set long-term goals: Instead of focusing on immediate rewards, set goals that yield future benefits. This could involve personal growth, career aspirations, or building meaningful relationships.  Develop resilience: Life is filled with challenges and setbacks. Being resilient during tough times – learning, adapting, and coming back stronger – is crucial for sustainable happiness.  Cultivate gratitude: Regularly reflecting on things you're grateful for can enhance overall satisfaction and positivity.  Invest in meaningful relationships: Strong, healthy relationships provide support, love, and a sense of community. Spend time with important people in your life and nurture those relationships.  Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness and meditation can help center you, reduce stress, and increase awareness of the present moment.  How to grow old happy and healthy?

      "Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emma Mehrabanpour Follow Ascent Publication -- Listen Share Do you dream that life would be better somewhere else? Do you wish that you could pack up your things and head off to a new place where life would surely be more exciting than life at home? In 2013, I did just that when I left England and moved to Dubai, in search of a “better life.” In many ways, I found it — gorgeous weather, tax-free money and a luxurious lifestyle (oh, and a husband 😉 ) However, in 2017, my newly-acquired husband and I decided that we’d enough of Dubai and set out to find an “even better” place to live. On our 16 month journey around the world, we met lots of people who were living away from their home country. Some were old friends from England who had emigrated to the US, Colombia and Australia, others were friends Dubai who had moved on to New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia. We were looking for a new home and so we keenly analysed our friends’ lives in these places — was life better here than in Dubai? Did they have better weather, better apartments, better lifestyles? In the end, after all that travelling, we ended up right back where we started. When people ask me why we came back, I list the same reasons that drew me to Dubai in the first place — weather, money, lifestyle. However, I’ve realised that all these reasons are actually just components of one overriding reason, which is: because we thought we’d be happier here than anywhere else. It’s the same reason that all our friends have moved around the globe. None of them were forced to go for work or family reasons, they had all actively chosen to move somewhere else, in the hope that they would be happier there. This trend of moving abroad in search of a better life is actually a relatively new phenomenon. The word “travel” comes from the word “travail”, which means work — that is, travel used to be something to be endured not enjoyed. People used to travel because they had to, not because they wanted to. These days, millions of people around the world choose to leave their home country to seek a new life elsewhere. The only explanation for this behaviour is that we believe we will be happier in another place. But are we right? Does where we live affect our happiness? Does it warrant moving across the world, leaving friends, family and familiarity behind? I think that people often believe they’ll be happier elsewhere because they only focus on the good parts of that place and fail to consider the bad. We thought that the Cayman Islands would be a perfect place to move to. We imagined the beautiful beaches, the watersports, (the Caribbean rum!) and couldn’t think of a more idyllic lifestyle. However, when we got there, we realised how small and expensive the island is. A perfect place for a holiday but, for us, definitely not somewhere we wanted to live. We’d only thought about the good stuff and not even considered the bad. It turns out even paradise has a downside. I think the reality is that the things that we think will make us happy actually have a relatively small impact on our happiness. Human beings are terrible at predicting what will make us happy. We think that things will make us happier than they actually do, because we fail to consider the fact that we will get used to them and their positive impact will quickly wear off. So when we imagine life in a new place, we think only about all the good parts and do not think of (a) the bad parts or (b) the fact that we will very quickly become accustomed to the good parts and they will no longer make us happy. We might enjoy the novelty of the new place for a while, but very quickly it just becomes the new daily life. It’s All About The People This human ability to adapt to new circumstances is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing in that we have a remarkable ability to recover from difficult life events, but a curse because we very quickly get used to new things and they rapidly lose their sparkle. However, there are certain things that never lose their sparkle — such as food, sleep and friends. However many meals you’ve eaten in your life, you will never say “oh, I’m bored of food, it just doesn’t excite me any more.” A good meal will always bring you satisfaction, especially if you’re hungry. Same with sleep — rest will always make you feel restored and rejuvenated. Of course, food and sleep are essential to our existence so it makes sense that we never get bored of them! However, what is interesting is that relationships also fall into this category of things that we do not adapt to. A good conversation with a close friend, a laughter-filled family meal or a romantic evening with your partner will always make you feel good, however many times you’ve done it. Unlike a new car, a new house or even a new country, which we eventually get used to and no longer bring us the same amount of pleasure, we never “get used to” our friends and family. They bring us the same amount of happiness, over and over again. When we imagine life in a new place, we are excited by the idea of an adventure, without realising that it won’t stay an adventure for long! We focus on things like climate, lifestyle and even money, that we will eventually get used to. We fail to focus on the thing that will make us happy wherever we are and whatever we do — that is, our friends and family. I think this is why many expats end up feeling rather lost and lonely — they have embarked on an exciting journey to find a better life, but find themselves without the friends, family and community to support them. I am very happy living in Dubai, but I’ve realized my happiness has very little to do with the place I live in. I’m happy here because I have my husband, some good friends, and I am able to see my family and friends from “home” fairly frequently. I know that, provided I have that network, I could be happy pretty much anywhere. It’s human nature to always be searching for something else, something better. Unfortunately, our brains are programmed to keep us permanently dissatisfied. Moving to a new place is a natural step in our endless quest to find a better, happier life. However, whenever making any life decision, it is worth identifying our reasons for making it and asking ourselves whether those things are likely to lose their sparkle, or keep sparkling no matter what.

      "Happiness is something we think about a lot at Buffer. It's been a cornerstone of our culture from the beginning (just take a look at this slide deck about it from way back in 2013). Though our values have evolved since then, you'll still see echoes of how important happiness is for us to cultivate in our most up-to-date version.  No surprise then that I thought it would be interesting to dig into the research on how to become a happier person. Spoiler: there's a lot of it! After combing through as much as I could, here are 11 of the simplest things that make you happy, according to science.  You've likely heard of endorphins, the pain and stress-relieving hormones released when you exercise. But the release of these feel-good chemicals is not the only dramatic effect that exercise can have on your body. Getting moving also triggers the release of more happiness hormones, serotonin and dopamine. On top of that, exercise increases your heart rate, which in turn pumps more oxygen to your brain. A well-oxygenated brain is as great as it sounds — many studies have found that this can help manage anxiety and depression, too. In Shawn Achor’s book, The Happiness Advantage, he cites a fascinating study on this. (The book is a great read, by the way — I'll be referring back to it a lot in this article!). In the study, three groups of patients treated their depression with either medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. The results of this study surprised me. Although all three groups experienced similar improvements in their happiness levels to begin with, the follow-up assessments proved to be radically different: \"The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate,\" Achor writes. \"Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent.\" Exercise can help you to relax, increase your brain power, and improve your body image. A study in the Journal of Health Psychology found that people who exercised felt better about their bodies, even when they saw no physical changes. The best part? This doesn’t mean you need to commit to a miles-long run or strenuous HIIT class every day to have a happy life — just 10 minutes of movement a day has been proven to be enough to boost happiness levels, according to The Journal of Happiness Studies. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), sleep deprivation dramatically impairs memory and concentration, disrupts your metabolism, and increases levels of stress hormones.  Beyond the severe physical consequences of getting enough sleep (“People who chronically fail to get enough sleep may actually be cutting their lives short,” the APA says), you don’t need me to tell you that a bad night’s sleep can seriously impact your mood.  A study published in the journal Sleep, which analyzed the sleep patterns of 30,594 people over the age of 16 in the U.K. across a period of 4 years, found that insufficient or poor sleep worsened emotional states.  With the widely used General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), a survey that helps determine health-related quality of life, they made some interesting comparisons with participants who got more and better sleep:  “Changes on the GHQ are comparable with those seen in mental health professionals completing an eight-week program of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy designed to improve psychological well-being,” researchers write.  “They are also comparable with the average improvement in well-being shown by U.K. lottery winners two years after a medium-sized lottery win.” Read: Getting more sleep will boost your mood as much as winning the lottery.  Our commute to the office can have a powerful impact on our happiness. The fact that we tend to do this twice a day, five days a week, makes it unsurprising that its effect would build up over time and make us less and less happy. Several studies have found that happiness and commute time are inversely proportional. As this paper in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health put it: “The longer the commute, the lower the satisfaction with work and life; the length of commuting can also cause damage to health, affecting physical health and causing inactivity.” Little wonder then that a commute that is a matter of seconds — i.e. the distance between your bedroom/kitchen/bathroom and your desk — is a huge factor in happiness and well-being. A 2023 study by Tracking Happiness found that remote workers are 20% happier than their in-office counterparts. In our most recent State of Remote Work report, 91 percent of respondents had had a positive experience of working remotely, while 98 percent said they would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, for the rest of their careers. Social time is highly valuable when it comes to improving our happiness, even for introverts. Several studies have found that time spent with friends and family makes a big difference to how happy we feel, generally. I love the way Harvard happiness expert Daniel Gilbert explains it: “We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends, and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.” Psychiatrist George Vaillant is the director of a 72-year study of the lives of 268 men, one of the most comprehensive longitudinal studies in history. In an interview in 2008, he was asked about what he'd learned from the men. Vaillant’s response: \"That the only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people.\" He shared insights of the study with The Atlantic's Joshua Wolf Shenk on how the men’s social connections made a difference to their overall happiness: “The men’s relationships at age 47, he found, predicted late-life adjustment better than any other variable, except defenses,\" Wolf Shenk writes. \"Good sibling relationships seem especially powerful: 93 percent of the men who were thriving at age 65 had been close to a brother or sister when younger.\" Great news for those of us who spend most of our days at our desks: you don't need to spend hours in the sunshine to reap the benefits of good old-fashioned fresh air. Spending time outdoors in a green space for just 20 minutes was enough to boost well-being, according to a study in the International Journal of Environmental Health Research. “Some people may go to the park and just enjoy nature,\" study co-author Hon Yuen told TIME. \"It’s not that they have to be rigorous in terms of exercise. You relax and reduce stress, and then you feel more happy.” If the idea of finding a space green enough to be considered 'nature' feels a bit far off, fear not — the study had participants visit urban parks in Birmingham, U.K., not Yosemite.  A study from the University of Sussex also found that being outdoors might contribute towards a happier life: “Being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, participants were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all-natural environments than they were in urban environments.” Interestingly, temperature can play a role, too. The American Meteorological Society published research that found current temperature has a bigger effect on our happiness than variables like wind speed and humidity, or even the average temperature over the course of a day. It also found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C (57°F), so keep an eye on the weather forecast before heading outside for your 20 minutes of fresh air. There are plenty of studies that show volunteering, random acts of kindness, or just giving someone else a compliment can boost your mood. In his book Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being, University of Pennsylvania professor Martin Seligman explains that helping others can improve our own lives: \"We scientists have found that doing a kindness produces the single most reliable momentary increase in well-being of any exercise we have tested.\" If we go back to Shawn Achor’s book, he says this about helping others: \"When researchers interviewed more than 150 people about their recent purchases, they found that money spent on activities — such as concerts and group dinners out — brought far more pleasure than material purchases like shoes, televisions, or expensive watches. Spending money on other people, called 'prosocial spending', also boosts happiness.\" Giving time, rather than money, is an option too: volunteering could be particularly beneficial. In a paper in the Journal of Happiness Studies, researchers examined data from nearly 70,000 subjects in the U.K. They found that people who had volunteered in the past year were more satisfied with their lives and rated their overall health as better.  They also discovered that volunteering more frequently meant greater benefits. Those who volunteered at least once a month reported better mental health than those who helped out irregularly or not at all.  Fun fact: The simple act of smiling causes the brain to release those feel-good hormones dopamine and serotonin.  Smiling itself can make us feel better, but it’s more effective when we back it up with positive thoughts, according to this study published in the Academy of Management Journal: “Customer-service workers who fake smiles throughout the day worsen their mood and withdraw from work, affecting productivity. But workers who smile as a result of cultivating positive thoughts — such as a tropical vacation or a child’s recital — improve their mood and withdraw less.” One of our previous posts goes into even more detail about the science of smiling. As opposed to actually taking a holiday, planning a vacation or just a break from work can improve our happiness. A study published in the journal Applied Research in Quality of Life showed that the highest spike in happiness came during the planning stage of a vacation as employees enjoyed a sense of anticipation, which boosted happiness for eight weeks. After the vacation, happiness quickly dropped back to baseline levels for most people. If you can’t take the time for a vacation right now, or even a night out with friends, put something on the calendar — even if it’s a month or a year down the road. Then whenever you need a boost of happiness, remind yourself about it. Meditation is often touted as an important habit for improving focus, clarity, and attention span, as well as helping to keep you calm. It turns out it’s also useful for improving your happiness. A study by Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation.  After the course, they scanned participants' brains again — and found that the parts of their brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank. According to Shawn Achor, meditation can make you happier long-term: “Studies show that in the minutes right after meditating, we experience feelings of calm and contentment, as well as heightened awareness and empathy. And, research even shows that regular meditation can permanently rewire the brain to raise levels of happiness.” If sitting down to meditate feels a bit intimidating, the simple act of taking a few deep breaths can work wonders. A study in Frontiers of Human Neuroscience, (titled ‘How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life’), found that deep breathing can reduce stress and increase emotional control.  Focusing on the breath is also a useful grounding practice in meditation and a great place to start. This is a seemingly simple strategy, but I’ve personally found it to make a huge difference to my outlook.  There are lots of ways to practice gratitude, from keeping a journal of things you’re grateful for, sharing three good things that happen each day with a friend or your partner, and going out of your way to show gratitude when others help you. In an experiment where some participants took note of things they were grateful for each day, their moods were improved just from this simple practice. Participants \"exhibited heightened well-being across several, though not all, of the outcome measures across the three studies, relative to the comparison groups,\" the authors of the study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology write. \"The effect on positive affect appeared to be the most robust finding. Results suggest that a conscious focus on blessings may have emotional and interpersonal benefits.\" The Journal of Happiness Studies published a paper that used letters of gratitude to test how being grateful can affect our levels of happiness. Participants included 219 men and women who wrote three letters of gratitude over a three-week period. \"Results indicated that writing letters of gratitude increased participants’ happiness and life satisfaction while decreasing depressive symptoms.\" Gratitude is still one of Buffer’s core values and something Bufferoos try to practice in their day-to-day work. A simple way we express gratitude to our coworkers every day is through our ‘#culture-gratitude’ channel in Slack, where we share when someone goes above and beyond in their work (which is pretty often).  Here’s a recent message from Maria, our Chief Product Officer, about Content Writer Tami: In an article for Psychology Today, Paula Davis J.D., M.A.P.P (who has a Master’s degree in positive psychology) writes that when it comes to happiness-boosting activities, one size does not fit all. “You tailor your workout to your specific fitness goals — happy people do the same thing with their emotional goals,” she says. “Some strategies that are known to promote happiness are just too corny for me, but the ones that work best allow me to practice acts of kindness, express gratitude, and become fully engaged.” A bonus point you didn't ask for: it’s interesting to note that as we get older, particularly past middle age, we tend to grow happier naturally. There’s still some debate over why this happens, but scientists have got a few ideas. According to this article in Perspectives on Psychological Science, researchers write: \"Older people shown pictures of faces or situations tend to focus on and remember the happier ones more and the negative ones less. Other studies have discovered that as people age, they seek out situations that will lift their moods — for instance, pruning social circles of friends or acquaintances who might bring them down.  \"Still other work finds that older adults learn to let go of loss and disappointment over unachieved goals, and hew their goals toward greater wellbeing.\" So if you thought being old would make you miserable, rest assured that it’s likely you’ll develop a more positive outlook than you probably have now.

      "One of Aesop’s most quoted lines goes, “It is possible to have too much of a good thing.” Another version of this line states “too much of a good thing is a bad thing”. We have all used these lines at one point in our lives. We also know how true these are for almost everything, may it be food, money, leisure, or work. If these lines are true for so many different areas of life, does this mean that it is also true for happiness? Is there such a thing as unhealthy happiness?? Happiness is generally perceived to be a good thing. We spend a great deal of time pursuing things we believe will make us happy. It is also a common belief that we can all benefit from becoming happier. With the numerous studies available that show happiness and positive emotions are important, how can happiness become a bad thing? Keep reading to find out how happiness can actually have a dark side and how being too happy can have a negative impact on our lives. Before you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Happiness & Subjective Wellbeing Exercises for free. These detailed, science-based exercises will help you or your clients identify sources of authentic happiness and strategies to boost wellbeing.  There are many everyday examples to show how too much of a good thing is actually bad for you. Dr. Robinson (2018) published an article on WebMD that talks about 12 Good Things That Can Go Bad. She shares how too much exercise can damage our joints and even lead to osteoporosis in women. On the other hand, sleeping beyond the recommended eight hours can increase the risk of heart problems. Activities like having sex, washing your hands, and eating healthy food, when done excessively, can all lead to serious health problems. She even explains that drinking too much water, to its extreme, can lead to death. Riggio (2013), in his article Too Much of Anything is Bad For You, focuses on personality traits, skills, and abilities to demonstrate how a good thing can become a bad thing. He talks about how things such as self-confidence, conscientiousness, and intelligence, when taken to an extreme, can become maladaptive behaviors. Self-confidence can come across as arrogance or narcism, while a person who is overly conscientious, can be perceived as a perfectionist. Even being extremely intelligent, especially with leaders, can contribute to the leader being ineffective because his followers may find it challenging to connect with him.  Happiness is positively correlated with so many different experiences such as achieving goals, creating good social connections, maintaining relationships and friendships, learning, and even increasing our own wellbeing. Despite the many good things happiness brings to our lives, recent studies show that happiness has a dark side. In 2011, Gruber, Mauss, and Tamir published their study titled “A Dark Side of Happiness? How, When, and Why Happiness Is Not Always Good”. Their study talks about how the pursuit of happiness does not always contribute to positive outcomes. Gruber and colleagues focused on four aspects of how happiness can have a dark side: intensity, timing, the pursuit of happiness, and types of happiness.\n",

      " These detailed, science-based exercises will equip you or your clients with tools to discover authentic happiness and cultivate subjective well-being. By filling out your name and email address below.  Intensity is the first aspect that Gruber and colleagues looked at when talking about happiness. Intensity refers to the “degree or amount of strength that something has” (Merriam-Webster, 2019). When something is said to be “intense” it usually means there is a sense of being extreme or too strong. In this case, “too happy” or “too positive” can mean an intense level of happiness. Contrary to popular beliefs, studies have shown that excess levels of experiences, emotions, and mental states can lead to becoming unhealthy (Gruber et al., 2011). This applies not only to negative experiences but also positive states like happiness. Research has found that intense degrees of happiness may be costly as it can lead to negative outcomes instead of benefiting us (Oishi, Diener, & Lucas, 2007). Scott Crabtree, in his Thrive From 9-5 Online Course, mentions that the ideal number for self-reported happiness is an 8 out of 10, with 10 being always happy. He explains that a person who is extremely happy, and always happy, may not be completely in touch with reality. This disengagement from reality, as a person experiences intense levels of happiness, may lead to risky behaviors and dysfunction in certain areas of our life. Moderate levels of happiness allow room for us to be able to still experience unpleasant emotions. These unpleasant experiences help us to learn and grow from them and to keep moving forward.  Just as the degree of happiness is important, timing is also an important aspect to consider. Gruber et al. state that happiness can also lead to negative outcomes when experienced in all situations. They also identified that there is likely a right time to feel happy, as well as a right time to experience negative emotions since emotions have an adaptive and functional role. Positive emotions, as identified in numerous studies, plays an important role in many contexts. Gratitude likely biases our attention towards rewards instead of seeing a threat in a situation. It can help us see the silver lining even in the midst of failure. The expression of gratitude also facilitates positive social interactions and signals the other person to respond with “you’re welcome” when a “thank you” is heard. Gratitude can also contribute to increasing the positive emotions of the other person. Gruber and colleagues looked at different studies to see how emotions play a role in the cognitive, physiological, and social perspectives. They identified specific situations for the three perspectives where negative emotions can be more beneficial than positive emotions. The cognitive perspective sees emotions as a filter that influences the way we gather, process, and interpret information. The way we feel impacts the information we attend to, as well as our cognitive processes like decision making, judgment, and creativity (Dalgleish & Power, 1999; Forgas, 2001; Martin & Clore, 2001, as cited in Gruber et al.). The physiological perspective looks at emotions as a trigger for action in a given situation. Our emotions cause a physical response which prepares our body to act on a specific stimulus (Ekman, 1992; Levenson, 2003; Plutchik, 1980, as cited in Gruber et al.). Lastly, the social perspective considers how emotions affect the way we interact and relate with people. Numerous studies show that the way we feel can help contribute to the response we elicit from others, to how we respond to others, and to how the social interaction plays out. On the other hand, negative emotions, such as experiencing fear, can help us to respond appropriately to a situation, specifically when we are in the context of a serious threat. On a cognitive level, fear helps us to pay attention to our surroundings and to possible threats around us. The fear we experience allows us to judge the situation and make decisions in order to deal with the threat. The physical response to fear causes our heart rates to rise as blood is pumped at a faster rate through our body (Cacioppo, Berntson, Larsen, Poehlmann, & Ito, 1993, as cited in Gruber et al.). Together, our brain and body prepare us to get into a fight or flight response if the need arises. Socially, expressing fear may evoke concern from others and signal them to help or provide assistance. Our fear can also limit our interactions with individuals we perceive to be a possible threat. The lack of fear, when faced with a threat, may prove to be detrimental since it prevents us from responding appropriately. Cognitively, we may not properly assess possible threats around us. When we are not afraid, our bodies also do not prepare for a fight or flight response which may cause a delay in action. Lastly, the people around us are likely to be unaware that we need help. It is also highly likely that because we are not afraid, we also do not know that we actually need help from others.  There are two main things that can come to mind when we talk about pursuing happiness. The first one is the idea that “I need to be happier”. The second one sounds more like “I should always be happy”. Crabtree states that when we become desperate as we pursue happiness, or when we try too hard to become happy, the pursuit backfires and eventually works against us. Similarly, Kesebir and Diener (2008) found that pursuing happiness can result in a paradoxical outcome. This means that the more a person pursued happiness, the more challenging it was to achieve it. Gruber and colleagues relate these paradoxical effects with those connected to achieving goals. They cite Carver and Scheier’s (1981) study where they found that the goals we set often come with specific standards. We use these standards to evaluate the way we achieve the goal and the actual achievement of this goal. These standards also tend to leave us disappointed. The paradox of pursuing happiness often comes with an expectation of what that happiness looks like and a standard of how we should feel when we achieve that happiness. It can likely become a never-ending self-defeating cycle. On the other hand, Gruber and colleagues suggest that there are specific ways to pursue happiness that do not involve directly pursuing it. These may even be more effective at increasing our happiness levels. Check out the Types of Happiness section below to find out what these activities are and how we can avoid that dark side of happiness.\n",

      "Despite this, several lines of research support the idea that the pursuit of happiness might lead us down a harmful path. In fact, the more individuals pursue positive emotions such as happiness, the less likely they are to experience said positive emotions and improvements to their wellbeing (Mauss, Savino, et al., 2011; Mauss, Tamir, Anderson, & Savino, 2011; Schooler, Ariely, & Loewenstein, 2003).\n",

Finally, it nudges us to stop monitoring how far away we are from being the happiest version of ourselves and instead remember the power of simply experiencing joy as it happens.  Finally, two types of happiness were explored (Gruber et al.) based on their working definition of happiness which states that happiness is when a person experiences only positive emotions. The first type is the happiness that impairs social functioning. Numerous studies have found that good social relationships contribute to our overall wellbeing (Rath & Harter, 2010). When a positive emotion impairs our social interactions, there is a high likelihood that our wellbeing decreases. An example they cited is that of pride, which is generally a positive emotion. A maladaptive form of pride may lead to arrogance and even aggressive behavior. These are likely to cause friction between the proud person and those around him. The second type of happiness they identified is the one that does not align with cultural values. Because cultures vary from each other, a specific positive emotion may be viewed differently among countries. They considered three dimensions such as the level of arousal, the social engagement aspect of emotions, and personal hedonic experiences. They cite numerous studies showing how different cultures differ in terms of their value of these three dimensions and the possible effects of these. They suggested that these two types of happiness may lead to possible negative effects, instead of contributing exclusively positive outcomes. \n",
      "  In addition to those already mentioned earlier, here are a few more examples, studies, and interesting facts that show how being too happy can have its disadvantages. Being too happy can make you… An experiment conducted on kids ages 6 to 7 and 10 to 11 found that extreme happiness may have negative effects on a child’s performance, specifically with detail-oriented tasks. (Schnall, Jaswal, & Rowe, 2008). Happier kids took more time to locate embedded figures based on images that were shown to them. Happier kids also found less embedded figures as compared to those that were induced into a neutral or sad mood. Schnall and colleagues explained that their results may likely be due to the fact that happiness tells us that things are good. When things are good, we are more likely to process global information first instead of local information. This means that we see the whole picture first before paying attention to the details in the picture. When we are in a neutral or sad state, it tells us that something might be missing or be wrong. This triggers to go through a more analytical process and pay more attention to details. Their results were consistent with that of another study done with adults, wherein participants either classified geometric figures or replicated a drawing from memory (Gasper & Clore, 2002). This study found that happier participants tended to pay more attention to the global features of a drawing or of the geometric figures present to them. Studies have shown that positive emotions are likely to promote creative and innovative ideas (Fredrickson, 2004). There is also evidence that shows how happiness and creativity positively correlate with each other (Adobe Systems Incorporated, 2016). However, these may only hold true for moderate levels of happiness. Davis (2009) found that while happiness can boost creativity, we no longer experience that same boost when we experience intense happiness. Scientists found that creativity builds on 14 different components (Jordanous & Keller, 2016) which seem to be related to problem-solving. When we are extremely happy, our brains zone in on the physical manifestations of happiness and on enjoying that happy moment instead of problem-solving (O’Faolan, 2016). It is possible that when we are too happy, our brains cannot go into problem-solving mode, thus making us less creative. Gruber (2012) explains that when we experience positive emotions, we are likely to focus on things that will sustain that happiness. We become more adventurous and more likely to take risks to find ways that sustain these good feelings. Cyders & Smith (2008) found that extreme positive emotions can increase our likelihood to engage in risky behaviors like binging on food and alcohol, using drugs and other substances, as well as engaging in risky sexual behavior. According to the researchers, the more we try to make ourselves happy, the less happy we feel. Some of the participants in this study were asked to make themselves feel as happy as possible while they listened to a certain type of music. Those who did not receive this instruction reported feeling more positive emotions than those who were told to make themselves as happy as possible. Mauss and colleagues found that the more participants valued happiness, the less likely they reported to feel happy after a specific task. Participants who highly valued happiness, when exposed to low stressful conditions, reported feeling lower levels of happiness. Similarly, participants who were induced to value happiness responded less positively when exposed to a stimulus that induces happy emotions. Based on everything that has been discussed so far, it seems apparent how being extremely happy can be a bad thing. Here are a few more interesting facts highlighted in Marta Zarakasa’s (2012) article in The Washington Post.

Happiness, despite its possible dark side, is still generally a good thing and it is still something we can benefit from. The negative effects of happiness are likely experienced when we have way too much of it. Here are a few tips on how we can avoid the dark side of happiness allowing ourselves to increase our wellbeing.  Nowadays, we have a tendency to hype-up how important it is to be happy. Yes, happiness is important. We also benefit so much from experiencing the good things in life. On the other hand, it is also important for us to remember that anything in excess can be a bad thing, even happiness. Happiness is letting go of what you think your life is supposed to look like and celebrating it for everything that it is. Mandy Hale We likely set ourselves up for disappointment by how highly we value happiness and by how we persistently pursue it. During these instances, we become more prone to experiencing the dark side of happiness. We can avoid this dark side, and continue to let happiness work for us, by not trying too hard to be happy. Instead, we can focus on accepting our present state and emotions, savoring our experiences, and engaging in activities that can increase our wellbeing. We hope you enjoyed reading this article.

In fact, it can be very destructive if taken to extremes. I once knew someone who was always extremely happy. On talking to her for only a few minutes it became obvious that she had no idea what was happening in the world and was completely detached from reality. Unfortunately, she even saw an element of positivity in things which were entirely negattive. Hi John,  thanks for your thought-provoking input!\n",
      "You’re totally right about how there can be a downside to being too happy all the time. Of course, happiness is great for us in so many ways, but we have to be careful not to lose touch with reality and become overly positive. At the end of the day, it’s all about finding the right balance! All the best!\n",

      "Julia | Community Manager Great article. Thank you for sharing! The human experience is filled with a multitude of emotions. It does seem limiting to keep focusing on the positive ones. Do you know if a person who enjoys too many hedonic experiences could become numb to them eventually? Hi Kashmira, Glad you enjoyed the article. This is a great question and has been explored in relation to a phenomenon known as the ‘hedonic treadmill.’ You can learn more about this phenomenon in our dedicated article here. – Nicole | Community Manager A beautifully written article, I would be really interested in knowing how the organisations can use this to improve  the productivity of there employees Hi Shurlly, We have a post on the benefits of positive psychology principles at work which may answer your questions.

      " Confédération suisse (de) Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft  (it) Confederazione svizzera  (rm) Confederaziun svizra  (la) Confoederatio Helvetica  46° 57′ N, 7° 25′ E modifier  La Suisse, en forme longue la Confédération suisse[9], est un État fédéral d'Europe centrale et de l'Ouest, formé de 26 cantons[10], avec Berne pour capitale de facto.\n",
      " La Suisse est bordée par l'Allemagne au nord, l'Autriche et le Liechtenstein à l'est-nord-est, l'Italie au sud et au sud-est et la France à l'ouest. C'est un pays sans littoral, dont le Rhin, sécurisé par des traités internationaux, constitue l’unique accès direct à la mer[11]. Le pays est géographiquement divisé entre les Alpes, qui occupent 60 % du territoire, le Plateau suisse et le Jura[12]. Sa population dépasse les 8,8 millions d'habitants[13], concentrés principalement sur le Plateau, là où se trouvent les plus grandes agglomérations et centres économiques : Zurich et Genève — qui sont des villes mondiales — puis Bâle (capitale dite culturelle du pays) et Lausanne (qui abrite le Tribunal fédéral). Toutes accueillent des organisations internationales et, pour les trois premières, un aéroport international.\n",
      " La Fête nationale suisse célèbre chaque 1er août la fondation de la Confédération suisse grâce au pacte d'alliance, datée du mois d'août 1291, entre les trois cantons primitifs : Uri, Schwytz et Unterwald. Le pays a une longue tradition de neutralité politique et militaire et n'a rejoint l'Organisation des Nations unies (ONU) qu'en 2002. Il poursuit cependant une politique étrangère active et s'implique fréquemment dans des processus humanitaires et de construction de la paix dans du monde[14]. La Suisse est le berceau du Comité international de la Croix-Rouge et abrite en outre de nombreuses organisations internationales, dont le deuxième plus grand siège de l'ONU après celui de New York : l'Office des Nations unies à Genève, ainsi que le siège de la Banque des règlements internationaux à Bâle, le siège de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé à Pregny-Chambésy et le siège du Comité international olympique à Lausanne. Dans le domaine européen, elle est un des membres fondateurs de l'Association européenne de libre-échange et membre de l'espace Schengen, mais pas de l'UE ni de l'Espace économique européen.\n",
      " La Suisse comporte quatre régions culturelles et linguistiques et quatre langues nationales : l'allemand, le français, l'italien et le romanche, cette dernière n'étant que partiellement officielle[10],[15]. En conséquence, les Suisses forment une nation au sens civique du terme (« Willensnation »), n'ayant pas d'unicité forte sur un plan ethnique ou linguistique. Le sens fort de l'identité et de la communauté des Suisses est fondé sur un fond historique commun et le partage de principes politiques et de caractéristiques telles que le fédéralisme, la démocratie directe[16], le symbolisme alpin[17] et des mythes fondateurs. L'intellectuel Ernest Renan la cite notamment comme exemple dans Qu'est-ce qu'une nation ?.\n",
      " La Suisse, qui est l'une des économies les plus libérales du continent[18], possède l'un des PIB nominaux par habitant et de parité du pouvoir d'achat les plus élevés au monde, ainsi que l'indice de développement humain (IDH) le plus élevé de la planète (0,962). Elle est classée deuxième sur la liste des pays par espérance de vie, publiée par le DAES des Nations unies ; et est considérée comme l'un des pays les moins corrompus, et — pendant plusieurs années — comme le premier en termes de compétitivité économique et touristique, selon le Forum économique mondial.\n",
      " Dans les autres langues nationales que le français, le pays est appelé Schweiz en allemand, Svizzera en italien et Svizra en romanche. Depuis 1803, le nom officiel de l'entité politique suisse est Confédération suisse en français, Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft en allemand, Confederazione Svizzera en italien, et Confederaziun svizra en romanche[19].\n",
      " Au XIXe siècle, le latin servait traditionnellement de langue commune pour les inscriptions officielles. Ainsi, la formule Confœderatio Helvetica se trouve notamment inscrite sur les pièces de monnaie suisses de 5, 10 et 20 centimes et sur les pièces de 5, 10 et 20 francs, mais pas sur les pièces de 50 centimes et de 1 et 2 francs — où ne figure que le nom « Helvetia » — ainsi qu'au fronton du Palais fédéral à Berne. Le sigle CH en est la forme abrégée pour les codes postaux et les extensions de noms de domaine sur Internet[20]. CH figure également sur l'autocollant distinctif de nationalité apposé à l'arrière des véhicules automobiles suisses circulant à l'étranger, en application de la Convention de Vienne sur la circulation routière[21],[22],[23].\n",
      " Depuis le milieu du XIVe siècle, le terme de confédération est employé pour qualifier les systèmes d'alliance qui se sont formés sur le territoire de la Suisse actuelle. Le mot français, comme ses équivalents dans les langues latines, est issu du latin foedus, « traité d'alliance », alors que l'allemand Eidgenossenschaft renvoie au « serment devant Dieu », Eid, prêté par des Genossen, « compagnons » de même rang. Le mode d'association ainsi désigné contraste avec la dissymétrie des liens de dépendance féodaux[24].\n",
      " Le nom Schweiz, d'où dérive le français Suisse, est utilisé dès le XVIe siècle par les Autrichiens, par déformation de celui du canton de Schwytz (Switz ou Sweitz en moyen haut allemand) qui est alors le canton géographiquement le plus proche de Vienne parmi les trois cantons d'origine, pour désigner l'ensemble de la communauté révoltée contre eux. Une confusion régna ensuite pendant plusieurs siècles sur l'orthographe utilisée par les deux toponymes (Schwytz et Schweiz). L'historien suisse Johannes von Müller proposa en 1785 de dissocier les deux formes[25]. Le terme de Schwytz, quant à lui, viendrait de celui apparu en 972 pour désigner la population de la région, les Suittes ; ce nom serait lui-même issu du vieux haut allemand swedan signifiant « brûler » (cf. islandais svíða, danois et suédois svide), rappelant ainsi la culture sur brûlis, technique par laquelle les habitants défrichaient les forêts avoisinantes afin de construire ou de cultiver les terrains[26].\n",
      " Le terme Confédération suisse ne devient courant qu'au XVIIIe siècle, où il n'est encore ni officiel ni unique, puisque les appellations Corps helvétique, Magna Liga, Ligues et Helvetia sont également utilisées pour désigner le pays[19],[27].\n",
      " La proposition de von Müller visant à utiliser l'appellation de Schweiz pour désigner la confédération fut officialisée en 1803, sinon dans l'Acte de Médiation lui-même[25], du moins par le titre de « Médiateur de la Confédération suisse » que prend Bonaparte à cette occasion. Elle est reprise à l'article 15 du Pacte fédéral de 1815 : « les XXII Cantons se constituent en Confédération suisse », puis par les constitutions de 1848, 1874 et 1999[19]. Aujourd'hui, dans la liste des dénominations d'États publiée par les autorités du pays, c'est celle de Confédération suisse qui est retenue, l'adjectif helvétique étant explicitement exclu[28].\n",
      " Cependant, au cours d'une évolution historique complexe, inscrite depuis 1848 dans le texte de ses constitutions successives, les institutions de la Suisse se sont éloignées de la confédération d'États pour devenir celles d'un État fédéral. Le maintien en vigueur d'une appellation officielle inchangée, bien qu'elle ne leur corresponde plus (du moins dans les langues latines : en allemand Eidgenossenschaft ne désigne pas une forme politique particulière), exprime l'idée d'une continuité de l'histoire suisse, depuis les alliances médiévales jusqu'à l'État contemporain[19].\n",
      " Confédération, avec ou sans majuscule, désigne trois concepts différents, qui correspondent chacun à un mot différent en allemand :\n",
      " La Suisse est habituellement divisée en trois grandes zones géographiques. Du nord au sud, ainsi que par superficie croissante, sont inclus le Jura, le Plateau suisse et les Alpes suisses. Le Plateau constitue par sa densité de population la zone la plus importante en matière démographique et économique.\n",
      " Mis à part les quelques plaines alluviales, du Rhin et du Rhône notamment, chaque région possède un relief plus ou moins marqué, des collines du Plateau et du Jura (1 000 - 1 600 m) aux sommets des Alpes (2 000 - 4 600 m).\n",
      " Bien que d'importance modeste du point de vue économique, la région alpine comporte les paysages les plus variés et les plus marquants de la Suisse. Elle s'étend sur près des deux tiers du pays (62,5 % du territoire), faisant de la Suisse le pays le plus montagneux d'Europe occidentale. Certains grands cantons se trouvent en totalité ou majoritairement à l'intérieur du périmètre alpin, ce sont le Valais, le Tessin et les Grisons.\n",
      " Selon la définition de l'Office fédéral de la statistique, un quart de la population de Suisse vit en région de montagne. Cela représente plus de 28 000 km2 répartis entre 814 communes[32].\n",
      " La topographie, notamment la barrière naturelle que forment les Alpes, est aussi à l'origine d'une grande variété de climats.\n",
      " Les chaînes de montagne principales (comprenant des sommets supérieurs à 4 000 m) sont quant à elles localisées dans les régions des cantons de Berne (Alpes bernoises), du Valais (Alpes valaisannes) et des Grisons (massif de la Bernina). Ce sont également les chaînes regroupant la plupart des glaciers en Suisse, dont elle est recouverte à hauteur de quelque 3 %. Enfin des sommets tels que le Cervin et l'Eiger ont gagné un statut emblématique de la chaîne alpine.\n",
      " La Suisse est située sur la ligne de partage des eaux de quatre bassins versants. Celui du Rhin couvre la plus grande partie du pays et celui du Rhône couvre le Valais, la partie sud du canton de Vaud et Genève. Cependant, des régions de Suisse appartiennent aussi aux bassins du Danube (la haute vallée de l'Inn dans les Grisons), du Pô et de l'Adige en Italie (le canton du Tessin avec notamment la rivière Tessin mais aussi quelques petites vallées des Grisons, avec les rivières Poschiavino, Maira et Rom (val Müstair) ainsi que la vallée de Simplon en Valais avec la rivière Diveria).\n",
      " Ainsi les eaux coulant en Suisse peuvent se diriger vers la mer du Nord, la mer Méditerranée occidentale, la mer Adriatique ou la mer Noire. Pour cette raison, il est parfois question de la région du Gothard comme du « château d'eau de l'Europe ».\n",
      " Presque chaque région compte un nombre d'étendues d'eau assez important. Les plus grandes sont situées sur le Plateau, ainsi qu'en bordure du territoire alpin. Les lacs de montagne proprement dits sont d'étendue modeste, mais particulièrement nombreux si les lacs de retenue destinés à la production d'hydroélectricité sont inclus.\n",
      " Le climat de la Suisse est un climat tempéré de transition, influencé par le climat océanique d'Europe de l'Ouest, le climat continental humide d'Europe centrale, le climat méditerranéen et le climat montagnard. Les précipitations sont réparties tout au long de l'année, parfois sous forme de neige en hiver. Les quatre saisons sont bien marquées, avec une différence d'environ 20 °C entre la température moyenne du mois le plus chaud (juillet) et le mois le plus froid (janvier).\n",
      " Les Alpes font effet de barrière climatique et provoquent des différences significatives de température et de quantité de pluie en fonction de la position géographique (microclimats). L'influence du climat méditerranéen est plus marquée au sud des Alpes, où les étés sont plus chauds et les hivers sont plus doux et plus secs par effet de foehn. L'influence du climat continental humide est plus marquée dans la partie est du pays avec des écarts de température plus importants et des pluies plus importantes en été.\n",
      " La température moyenne diffère en fonction de l'altitude du lieu et de la période de l'année, du fait du relief accidenté, il peut exister plusieurs étages avec des climats et des milieux naturels différents sur les façades d'une montagne. Dans les basses terres telles que le Plateau suisse (500 m) la température dépasse 30 °C durant les jours les plus chauds de l'été — de juin à septembre — et peut descendre en dessous de 0 °C en hiver — de décembre à mars. La température moyenne diminue de 1 degré tous les 300 m. Au-dessus de 1 500 m d'altitude la saison d'hiver dure du mois de novembre au mois d'avril, et la neige subsiste durant toute la saison – condition favorable aux sports d'hiver. Au-dessus de 3 000 m la neige subsiste toute l'année et la température monte rarement au-dessus de 10 °C. L'ensoleillement, élevé dans tout le pays durant l'été, est faible dans les vallées et le plateau durant l'hiver à cause du phénomène de brouillard de vallée.\n",
      " Par effet de foehn sur les Alpes, lorsque le vent chaud du sud souffle vers le nord, il provoque un temps pluvieux et doux sur la façade sud des Alpes, et un temps sec et chaud sur la façade nord. Quand, au contraire, le vent froid du nord souffle vers le sud, il provoque un temps pluvieux et froid sur la façade nord, et un temps ensoleillé et doux au sud. Située dans les Alpes internes, la région du Valais reçoit de l'air sec toute l'année.\n",
      " La bise est un vent froid et sec venu du nord-est, fréquent en hiver. Elle provoque une chute de température, un ciel dégagé et une impression de froid accentuée par le souffle des rafales qui peuvent atteindre 100 km/h[35].\n",
      " La Suisse, selon un rapport officiel de 2007[36], est un pays notablement exposé aux conséquences du changement climatique, en raison de l'importance de ses glaciers, lesquels reculent et vont encore reculer et peut-être disparaître d'ici 100 ans[37]. Le risque d'inondation, coulée de boue, glissement de terrain ou chute de pierre augmente. Des cartes de danger ont été établies (fin 2007) pour 30 % du territoire. Le nombre de jours de canicule (température> 30 °C) a fortement augmenté[38], passant au Tessin d'une moyenne d'un à deux jours par an dans les années 1960 à presque 15 aujourd'hui. De même sur le plateau, avec une augmentation encore plus forte à Zurich et à Genève (quatre fois plus de jours de canicule depuis les années 1960). Les hivers se réchauffent aussi, avec moins de jours d'enneigement, surtout à moins de 1 500 mètres. Les chutes de neige sont plus tardives, y compris à haute altitude, ce qui peut avoir un impact sur le tourisme et les sports d'hiver (en 2019, 50 % environ des pistes ont dû recevoir un enneigement artificiel qui n'est pas sans conséquences sur la gestion de l'eau).\n",
      " Au début des années 2000, la floraison des cerisiers était en moyenne plus précoce de 15 à 20 jours qu'en 1950. Les cours d'eau du Plateau suisse se réchauffent depuis les années 1960 et l'eau y dépasse 18 °C un nombre de jours croissant par an, avec en parallèle une diminution des truites de rivière qui ont besoin d'eau froide et riche en oxygène.\n",
      " En 2022, la température a augmenté de +2 °C en 150 ans. Depuis les années 2000, la Suisse a connu neufs de ses 10 années les plus chaudes. Comme conséquences, le volume des glaciers suisses a vu une baisse significative de 60 % depuis la moitié du XIXe siècle[39].\n",
      " Les émissions de gaz à effet de serre ont été stabilisées vers 1990, sans toutefois être diminuées (objectif de l'ONU : −6 % par an[40]). La Suisse s'est donné l'objectif de ramener à 0 ses émissions nettes de gaz à effet de serre en 2050. Cela implique de passer de 118,7 Mt équivalent CO2 à 6 Mt (absorption nette de la forêt et des sols envisagée[41]) en 30 ans soit une réduction d'environ −9,5 % par an[42],[43]. Le programme « SuisseÉnergie » incite aux mesures volontaires de l'industrie. Les émissions agricoles ont reculé, alors que les émissions du transport augmentaient, ainsi que celle de l'habitat, en lien avec la croissance (démographique et économique). La surface de référence énergétique des bâtiments certifiés (Minergie et Minergie-P) augmente depuis 1998 plus vite que dans la plupart des autres pays d'Europe, mais en 2006, ne concernait que 0,9 % de la surface de référence énergétique totale du pays.\n",
      " D'après une enquête du journal Le Temps, la Suisse dépasse régulièrement les pics de pollution autorisés par l'ordonnance sur la protection de l'air, mais les autorités préfèrent ne pas donner l'alerte auprès de la population[44].\n",
      " Un autre accord a été conclu avec le Pérou pour pouvoir comptabiliser pour la Suisse des puits de carbone réalisés dans ce pays[45].\n",
      " En 2020, la Suisse a produit plus de 53 millions de tonnes de gaz à effet de serre du principalement au chauffage de logements et aux transports qui sont principalement des voitures à moteurs thermiques[46].\n",
      " La Suisse dispose de milieux naturels de qualité et abrite une biodiversité importante avec environ 50 000 espèces répertoriées (pour la faune, flore et fonge), mais dont 30 à 50 % des indigènes sont menacées[47] (comme dans la plupart des pays européens), alors qu'une centaine d'espèces invasives posent problème[48].\n",
      " Du fait du relief, la population (à 75 % urbaine) est très concentrée, mais l'urbanisation s'étale (périurbanisation). En 2000, chaque habitant consommait une surface habitable de 44 m2, soit 10 m2 de plus qu'en 1980, alors que le nombre de ménages s'était accru de 27 % dans le même temps. La fragmentation écopaysagère est importante et croissante[49] ainsi que l'artificialisation des milieux. Le nombre de kilomètres parcourus sur la route a presque doublé en 34 ans (de 1970 à 2004), et les surfaces imperméabilisées et construites, routes et parkings ont augmenté simultanément d'environ 10 % de 1982 à 1995.\n",
      " Environ un milliard de mètres cubes d'eau potable sont distribués annuellement par les robinets (soit l'équivalent en volume du lac de Bienne).\n",
      " Les énergies renouvelables sont en progression, mais l'énergie finale consommée a augmenté de +11,5 % entre 1990 et 2005, avec une forte hausse (+23 % de 1990 à 2005) de la consommation électrique. Les sols se dégradent ou sont construits (11 hectares de sol agricoles sont quotidiennement perdus et plus de 15 % des sols analysés de 1992 à 1996 dépassaient des valeurs-seuil ou indiquant une pollution pour un ou plusieurs métaux lourds. 61 % des sols arables sont sensibles à l'érosion, 17 % l'étant fortement). Des progrès sont constatés en matière de pollution de l'air (moins de pluies acides, de métaux, de poussières à l'extérieur), mais en 2000, plus de 40 % des habitants étaient chez eux exposés à des taux de poussières fines (PM10) dépassant les valeurs limites. L'ozone (O3) et les oxydes d'azote (NOx) posent également problème[50]. La pollution y est quand même inférieure à celle de la plupart des pays d'Europe tels que la France ou l'Espagne.\n",
      " En 2018 et 2019, l'ensemble des forêts du nord-ouest de la Suisse est atteinte par la mort en masse des hêtres du fait du changement climatique[51].\n",
      " Zurich, ville la plus peuplée de Suisse avec 421 878 habitants (2022)[52], se trouve au nord-est du pays, à l'extrémité nord du lac de Zurich. C'est la capitale économique et la principale place bancaire du pays. Elle héberge l'École polytechnique fédérale de Zurich. La ville est desservie par le principal aéroport ainsi qu'un performant réseau de voies ferrées et quelques autoroutes. Avec 360 000 passagers quotidiens, la gare centrale de Zurich est très importante.\n",
      " Genève, deuxième ville du pays avec 203 856 habitants (2022)[52]et première ville suisse en densité de population, se trouve à l'extrême ouest du pays à la pointe du Léman. L'agglomération se développe également de l'autre côté de la frontière, en France. Genève est le siège de nombreuses organisations internationales, d'organisations non gouvernementales, de banques privées et d'entreprises horlogères.\n",
      " Bâle, troisième ville avec 173 863 habitants (2022)[52], se trouve au nord-ouest du pays. L'agglomération se développe également de l'autre côté de la frontière, en France et en Allemagne. La ville est traversée par le Rhin et dispose de l'unique port fluvial du pays, ainsi que du troisième aéroport du pays, l'aéroport international de Bâle-Mulhouse-Fribourg. Elle accueille de nombreuses industries pharmaceutiques, l'université la plus ancienne du pays et le siège mondial de la Banque des règlements internationaux. La ville est aussi célèbre pour ses musées, comme le Kunstmuseum (plus ancienne collection d'art publique au monde) ou la Fondation Beyeler à Riehen.\n",
      " Lausanne, quatrième ville avec 149 490 habitants (Mai 2023)[52],se trouve à l'ouest du pays au bord du Léman. Elle est le siège du Tribunal fédéral, de l'École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne et du Comité international olympique.\n",
      " Berne, cinquième ville avec 134 794 habitants (2022)[52], se trouve au centre-ouest. C'est la ville fédérale, siège du gouvernement et des principales institutions fédérales.\n",
      " La Suisse compte 2 136 communes au 1er janvier 2023[53].\n",
      " Peuplé dès la Préhistoire, c'est à l'époque celtique grâce aux Helvètes surtout, que le territoire suisse franchit le seuil de l'Histoire. En 58 av. J.-C., les Helvètes, sous la pression migratoire des tribus germaniques, tentent de s'installer dans le Sud-Ouest de la Gaule, en Saintonge (actuelle Charente et Charente-Maritime). Battus près de Bibracte par les armées de Jules César, ils sont reconduits sur leur territoire d'origine qui devient ensuite part de l'Empire romain.\n",
      " Largement christianisé, le territoire suisse est ensuite occupé par les Burgondes et les Alamans au Ve siècle. Incorporé successivement aux royaumes de Bourgogne, des Francs, puis à l'Empire carolingien, il est rattaché au XIe siècle, à la chute du royaume de Bourgogne transjurane, au Saint-Empire romain germanique. Il est alors le théâtre de dures luttes féodales.\n",
      " La date de 1291 est choisie à la fin du XIIIe siècle comme date de naissance de la Suisse, car c'est celle du Pacte fédéral, le plus vieux document écrit connu parlant du renouvellement d'une précédente alliance entre des cantons suisses : Uri, Schwytz, qui donnera son nom au pays, et Nidwald[54],[55] (vallée inférieure d'Unterwald). Ces cantons confirment en 1315 leur alliance par le pacte de Brunnen, conclu après la bataille de Morgarten, qu'ils remportent contre Léopold Ier d'Autriche.\n",
      " Les territoires avoisinants, Lucerne, Zurich, Glaris, Zoug et Berne se rapprochent d'eux au XIVe siècle, fondant le pays actuellement nommé la Confédération des VIII cantons. Le XVe siècle est parsemé de conquêtes et voit la Confédération atteindre le Rhin et la Suisse romande, tout en s'alliant avec les territoires environnants que sont le Valais, Appenzell, Saint-Gall, les Ligues grises (canton des Grisons) et Fribourg. Le pays participe à la guerre de Bourgogne de 1474 à 1477, puis est le théâtre de celle de Souabe en 1499 à la suite de quoi la Confédération suisse est reconnue de facto par le Saint-Empire romain germanique (traité de Bâle). Ce n'est cependant qu'après la guerre de Trente Ans, lors de la signature des traités de Westphalie en 1648, que l'existence de la Confédération suisse est officiellement et définitivement reconnue.\n",
      " La fin du XVe siècle voit une première opposition entre les villes et campagnes qui aboutit finalement au convenant de Stans, signé en 1481 avec l'aide de Nicolas de Flüe, qui ouvre la porte à cinq nouveaux cantons : Fribourg, Soleure, Appenzell, Bâle et Schaffhouse. Ainsi, le début du XVIe siècle voit la naissance de la Confédération des XIII cantons qui renforce ses alliances locales avec Bienne, Saint-Gall et Neuchâtel et étend ses possessions au Tessin et dans le canton de Vaud. Les guerres d'Italie et surtout la bataille de Marignan (1515) sonnent la fin de ses activités militaires hors de son territoire. Seuls les mercenaires suisses feront désormais parler d'eux sur les champs de bataille européens et au Vatican.\n",
      " Déchiré par la Réforme, le pays se divise et est le théâtre de plusieurs guerres de religion : les Première et Deuxième guerres de Kappel (1529 et 1531), la Première guerre de Villmergen (1656), la Deuxième guerre de Villmergen (1712) occupent la politique intérieure. La démocratie des premiers temps laisse la place à des gouvernements oligarchiques qui bloquent les réformes proposées par les Lumières.\n",
      " Les succès économiques de la Suisse en font vite le banquier de l'Europe. Les progrès importants dans l'espérance de vie et son estimation qui se produisent au milieu du XVIIIe siècle, grâce aux tables de mortalité et à la vaccination, permettent à la communauté financière genevoise de financer la dette publique française par le biais des rentes viagères au moment des lourdes dépenses militaires de l'expédition Lafayette\n",
      " La domination française exercée après l'invasion de 1798 réforme la Suisse en la transformant en un État unitaire appelé République helvétique. En effet, devant les troubles intérieurs incessants, Napoléon impose l'Acte de Médiation en 1803, par lequel il crée plusieurs nouveaux cantons (Vaud, Tessin, Argovie, Thurgovie et Saint-Gall devenant alors des cantons à part entière). Dans le même temps, il intègre au Premier Empire la principauté de Neuchâtel, remise au maréchal Louis-Alexandre Berthier, ainsi que les républiques de Genève, annexée au département du Léman depuis 1798, et du Valais qui devient en 1810 le département du Simplon.\n",
      " Après le départ de l'armée napoléonienne et presque deux ans de tractations, 1815 voit la création d'un État de 22 cantons reconnu comme neutre par l'« Acte de reconnaissance de la neutralité perpétuelle de la Suisse » rédigé par Charles Pictet de Rochemont et signé lors du congrès de Vienne. En effet, Neuchâtel, Valais et Genève pensaient que le temps des petits États indépendants était définitivement terminé et avaient négocié leur entrée dans la Suisse en tant que cantons à part entière. En 1847 cependant, les luttes entre les conservateurs et les libéraux-radicaux aboutissent à la guerre du Sonderbund et à la victoire de ces derniers qui en profitent pour créer, en 1848, un État fédéral qui abolit les frontières intérieures, impose une monnaie unique et une armée de milice fédérale. La première constitution fédérale, acceptée le 12 septembre 1848 met en place les bases politiques de la Suisse. Elle est ensuite révisée en 1874 pour y ajouter le droit de référendum puis en 1891 celui d'initiative populaire.\n",
      " Parallèlement aux événements politiques, le XIXe siècle voit l'essor du tourisme et des premiers voyages organisés, en particulier dans les régions alpines. Le développement de l'infrastructure touristique (transports, hôtellerie) prend de l'ampleur.\n",
      " Le début du XXe siècle voit la suite du travail législatif : un code pénal, puis un code civil fédéral sont créés. La Suisse échappe aux deux guerres mondiales et devient peu à peu le siège de nombreuses organisations internationales.\n",
      " C'est en février 1971 que les Suisses, après plusieurs refus, acceptent avec une majorité de 65,7 % la participation des femmes à la vie politique fédérale. L'adhésion de la Suisse et son intégration aux principales organisations internationales (Conseil de l'Europe en 1963, Organisation des Nations unies le 10 septembre 2002) se font également avec un décalage par rapport à ses voisins.\n",
      " Une nouvelle constitution est acceptée en votation populaire le 18 avril 1999 et entre en vigueur le 1er janvier 2000[56].\n",
      " La démocratie directe et le fédéralisme caractérisent le système politique suisse. Les citoyens suisses sont soumis à trois juridictions : la commune, le canton et l'État fédéral. Les Constitutions suisses de 1848, 1874 et 1999 définissent un système de démocratie directe (parfois appelée démocratie directe semi-directe ou représentative parce qu’elle est soutenue par les institutions les plus courantes d’une démocratie représentative). Les instruments de ce système au niveau fédéral, appelés droits populaires (en allemand : Volksrechte, en italien : diritti popolari), comprennent le droit de présenter une initiative fédérale et un référendum, qui peuvent tous deux infirmer des décisions parlementaires.\n",
      " En convoquant un référendum fédéral, un groupe de citoyens peut contester une loi adoptée par le Parlement, s’ils recueillent 50 000 signatures contre la loi dans les 100 jours. Si tel est le cas, un vote national est prévu lorsque les électeurs décident à la majorité simple d’accepter ou de rejeter la loi. N’importe quels 8 cantons réunis peuvent aussi convoquer un référendum constitutionnel sur une loi fédérale.\n",
      " De même, l’initiative constitutionnelle fédérale permet aux citoyens de soumettre une modification constitutionnelle à un vote national, si 100 000 électeurs signent la modification proposée dans un délai de 18 mois. Le Conseil fédéral et l’Assemblée fédérale peuvent compléter l’amendement proposé par une contre-proposition, et les électeurs doivent alors indiquer une préférence sur le bulletin de vote si les deux propositions sont acceptées. Les amendements constitutionnels, qu’ils soient introduits par initiative ou au Parlement, doivent être acceptés à la double majorité du vote populaire national et du vote populaire cantonal.\n",
      " La Suisse est depuis 1848 une fédération de cantons, aujourd'hui au nombre de 26 :\n",
      " \n",
      " La superficie des cantons varie entre 37 et 7 105 km2 et leur population de 16300 à 1 533 600 habitants (2020)[60].\n",
      " Les cantons sont souverains selon leur constitution respective, mais ne sont plus indépendants comme aux premières heures de la Suisse : le terme de Confédération, s'il reflète ce passé, ne correspond donc plus à la configuration actuelle de fédéralisme. La répartition actuelle des compétences entre la Confédération et les cantons est formalisée dans la constitution fédérale, qui précise les limites de leurs souverainetés respectives. Certaines compétences sont attribuées explicitement aux cantons ou à la Confédération ; ce qui n'est pas explicitement délégué à la Confédération est du ressort des cantons[61].\n",
      " Chaque canton est divisé en communes. De nombreux cantons ont une subdivision intermédiaire nommée district, ou équivalente (les arrondissements administratifs du canton de Berne par exemple). Chaque canton dispose de sa propre constitution. La Constitution fédérale garantit leur autonomie : ils prélèvent des impôts et adoptent des lois dans tous les domaines qui ne relèvent pas de la compétence de la Confédération. Un certain nombre de domaines sont ainsi gérés uniquement au niveau cantonal. On y trouve par exemple l'éducation (sauf les deux écoles polytechniques fédérales et la Haute école fédérale de sport de Macolin), la gestion des hôpitaux (sauf les hôpitaux communaux et privés), la construction et l'entretien de la majorité des routes (sauf les autoroutes et routes nationales) et la police (contrairement à l'armée), d'autres cotisations sociales, ou encore le contrôle de la fiscalité. La souveraineté des cantons se limite donc à certains domaines et est en outre toujours limitée par le principe de la primauté du droit fédéral, ou force dérogatoire du droit fédéral (contrairement à l'équipollence des normes en vigueur en Belgique).\n",
      " Les cantons ont tous leur propre parlement (appelé Grand Conseil dans la plupart des cantons francophones) et leur gouvernement (appelé Conseil d'État dans la plupart des cantons francophones). La structure politique de la Suisse est composée du pouvoir législatif, du pouvoir exécutif et du pouvoir judiciaire. Chaque canton définit la composition et le fonctionnement des trois pouvoirs. En principe, il appartient aux cantons d'appliquer non seulement le droit cantonal, mais aussi le droit fédéral (fédéralisme d'exécution, contrairement aux États-Unis et à la Belgique).\n",
      " Le pouvoir législatif est exercé par l'Assemblée fédérale, qui est formée de deux chambres : le Conseil national (200 membres), formé des représentants du peuple, et le Conseil des États (46 membres). Au Conseil national, le nombre de sièges par canton est proportionnel à sa population. Au Conseil des États, les cantons possèdent deux sièges, à l'exception des cantons d'Obwald, Nidwald, Bâle-Ville, Bâle-Campagne, Appenzell Rhodes-Extérieures et Appenzell Rhodes-Intérieures qui ont un siège ; ils étaient appelés « demi-cantons » sous l'empire de la constitution de 1874 aujourd'hui remplacée par celle de 1999. Les membres du Conseil national sont élus pour 4 ans, tandis que le mandat des membres du Conseil des États dépend du droit cantonal.\n",
      " Organisé en régime directorial, le pouvoir exécutif est exercé par le Conseil fédéral, formé de sept membres (conseillers fédéraux), et de l'administration fédérale qui lui est subordonnée. Les membres du Conseil fédéral sont élus pour quatre ans par l'Assemblée fédérale, qui, en règle générale, reconduit les candidats sortants si ces derniers désirent poursuivre leurs fonctions. Cependant, cette règle tacite a été mise à mal lors de l'élection de décembre 2003 avec la non-réélection de la conseillère fédérale démocrate-chrétienne Ruth Metzler-Arnold, évincée au profit du candidat de l'Union démocratique du centre (UDC) Christoph Blocher, lui-même non réélu en 2007 et remplacé par Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf (UDC, puis PBD). Cette situation a donc modifié la répartition des sièges en fonction des partis politiques pour la première fois depuis l'introduction de la formule magique en 1959. Cette dernière vise à répartir les sièges du gouvernement fédéral proportionnellement au poids de chaque parti à l'Assemblée fédérale. Depuis 1959, et malgré la progression depuis le début des années 1990 de l'UDC, cette répartition n'avait jamais été modifiée et était composée comme suit : deux sièges pour le Parti radical-démocratique (PRD), 2 pour le Parti démocrate-chrétien (PDC), 2 pour le Parti socialiste (PSS) et un siège pour l'UDC. Les élections fédérales de l'automne 2003 ayant confirmé la montée en puissance de l'UDC, les partis gouvernementaux se sont résolus, sous une certaine pression populaire, à revoir la répartition des sièges du Conseil fédéral. À la suite du départ d'Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf (PBD), il est désormais composé de deux sièges pour le PLR, 2 pour le PS, 2 pour l'UDC et 1 pour le PDC.\n",
      " Le Conseil fédéral fonctionne selon le principe de collégialité, ce qui signifie que les décisions sont prises le plus possible par consensus. Si tel n'est pas le cas, un vote a lieu parmi les sept conseillers fédéraux. Selon ce principe, ceux qui s'opposent à une mesure qui est adoptée par le collège doivent tout de même défendre le projet au nom de celui-là. Mais ce principe a connu quelques distorsions ces dernières années, notamment lors de campagnes précédant des votations populaires : un précédent plus ancien étant le refus de Kurt Furgler (PDC) de défendre la loi légalisant l'avortement devant le peuple pour des raisons de conscience, ce qui n'a pas empêché le souverain de l'adopter.\n",
      " Les sept départements fédéraux incluent le Département fédéral des affaires étrangères, le Département fédéral de l'intérieur, le Département fédéral de justice et police, le Département fédéral de la défense, de la protection de la population et des sports, le Département fédéral des finances, le Département fédéral de l'économie et le Département fédéral de l'environnement, des transports, de l'énergie et de la communication.\n",
      " Un président de la Confédération est élu pour une année parmi les conseillers fédéraux par l'Assemblée fédérale[62]. Son rôle est principalement symbolique et médiatique. Traditionnellement, les conseillers fédéraux sont élus présidents chacun à leur tour en fonction de leur ancienneté.\n",
      " Le pouvoir judiciaire est exercé par les tribunaux fédéraux.\n",
      " Une particularité de la démocratie suisse est que le peuple garde en permanence un contrôle sur ses élus, car la Suisse est une démocratie qui peut être qualifiée de semi-directe, dans le sens où elle a des éléments d'une démocratie représentative (élection des membres des parlements ainsi que des exécutifs cantonaux) et d'une démocratie directe. En effet, en Suisse, le corps électoral dispose de deux instruments qui lui permettent d'agir sur un acte décidé par l'État : il s'agit du référendum, qui peut être facultatif ou obligatoire, et de l'initiative populaire qui est le droit d'une fraction du corps électoral de déclencher une procédure permettant l'adoption, la révision, ou l'abrogation d'une disposition constitutionnelle.\n",
      " Le référendum facultatif permet de remettre en cause une loi votée par l'Assemblée fédérale. Il est facultatif car il nécessite la récolte de 50 000 signatures en l'espace de 100 jours pour qu'il aboutisse à une consultation populaire. Si tel n'est pas le cas, la loi est considérée comme adoptée. Lors de la votation, seule la majorité de la population est prise en compte. Le référendum obligatoire impose, comme son nom l'indique, automatiquement une consultation populaire dans les cas prévus par la constitution fédérale. Il implique la double majorité de la population et des cantons.\n",
      " L'armée suisse est composée des forces terrestres et des forces aériennes. La Suisse n'ayant pas de côte océanique, la marine est inexistante mais une flotte de bateaux armés est maintenue sur les lacs frontaliers. La particularité de l'armée suisse est son système de milice. Les soldats professionnels constituent seulement environ 5 % du personnel militaire. Le reste est formé par des citoyens conscrits âgés de 18 à 34 ans (dans certains cas jusqu'à 50 ans). Les citoyens suisses (à l'exception des binationaux) n'ont pas le droit de servir dans des armées étrangères à l'exception de la Garde pontificale.\n",
      " La structure du système de milice stipule que le soldat garde chez lui son propre équipement, incluant le bien connu couteau suisse et l'arme personnelle. Ceci n'est pas sans susciter des controverses de la part de certains partis politiques et d'associations. Le service militaire obligatoire concerne tous les citoyens suisses de sexe masculin. Ces derniers reçoivent en général leur ordre de marche vers 19 ans pour le recrutement. Les femmes peuvent aussi servir dans l'armée sur base volontaire. Annuellement, environ 24 000 personnes sont entraînées dans des écoles de recrue pendant 18 à 21 semaines. La réforme Armée XXI a été adoptée par vote populaire en 2003, remplaçant le modèle Armée 95 (qui lui-même avait remplacé le modèle Armée 61 avec près de 800 000 soldats mobilisables), et réduisant les effectifs de 400 000 à environ 210 000 personnes, parmi lesquelles 130 000 sont en service actif et 80 000 sont des unités de réserve[63].\n",
      " En tout, trois mobilisations générales ont été ordonnées pour assurer l'intégrité et la neutralité de la Suisse. La première à l'occasion de la guerre franco-prussienne de 1870. La seconde au déclenchement de la Première Guerre mondiale en août 1914. La troisième en septembre 1939, en réponse à l'attaque allemande de la Pologne ; Henri Guisan fut élu général.\n",
      " La Suisse ne fait pas partie de l'Union européenne, mais entretient des relations étroites avec elle[64],[65], grâce à différents accords. Environ vingt accords principaux et une centaine d'accords secondaires, en tout, ont été conclus au fil des ans dont l'Accord de libre-échange (AELE) de 1972, l'Accord sur les assurances de 1989, les Accords bilatéraux I de 1999 et les Accords bilatéraux II de 2004. Afin, notamment, de simplifier la gestion de ce portefeuille, l'UE et la Suisse ont engagé des négociations en vue d'un accord global en 2014, mais elles sont abandonnées en 2021[66].\n",
      " Sur le plan économique, au niveau du commerce extérieur en 2008, 62 % des exportations, pour un montant de 128 050,7 millions de francs suisses et 81,2 % des importations pour un montant de 151 775,2 millions de francs suisses, se sont faites avec l'Union européenne. Sur le plan humain, en 2008, 405 393 Suisses vivent dans l'Union européenne et 1 026 495 citoyens européens vivent en Suisse[67].\n",
      " Le peuple suisse a été amené à se prononcer à de nombreuses reprises depuis le 9 octobre 1992, où les Suisses refusèrent à 50,3 % de faire partie de l'Espace économique européen[68], sur les relations qu'il voulait entretenir avec l'Union européenne. Ce fut le cas notamment sur les accords bilatéraux et l'entrée de la Suisse dans l'espace Schengen qui, après acceptation, permirent aux citoyens membres de l'Union européenne de se voir faciliter l'entrée et l'emménagement en Suisse, et vice-versa[69].\n",
      " Sur le plan du transit des camions provenant de l'Union européenne, le peuple suisse s'est prononcé par référendum, en 1991, en faveur de l'introduction d'une redevance poids lourds liée aux prestations et en 1992 sur la construction de nouvelles lignes ferroviaires à travers les Alpes, entièrement financée par la Suisse, pour inciter les camions européens circulant sur ses routes à transiter par voie de chemin de fer par le biais du ferroutage.\n",
      " Les habitants de la Suisse sont les Suisses[70]. En Suisse, les habitantes sont appelées Suissesses ou Suisses. Le terme Suissesse présent dans la Constitution de la Suisse de 1999 est adopté par l'administration fédérale[71]. Ce terme est mentionné à partir de 1786 dans le Dictionnaire de l'agriculture et de la campagne : avec vocabulaire des mots de l'abbé Étienne-Modeste Besançon[72].\n",
      " Toutefois, certaines études linguistiques plus récentes ne retiennent, au féminin, que le gentilé « Suissesse ». C'est, notamment, le cas du linguiste Elmar Eggert (docteur en linguistique à l'université de Tours) qui, dans une étude de 2005, relève : « le gentilé, un Suisse, qui, dans sa forme féminine, se dit une Suissesse »[73]. Les linguistes Denis Maurel et Odile Piton estiment également que le féminin du gentilé Suisse est Suissesse, ainsi qu'ils l'ont énoncé lors du colloque international Fractal : linguistique et informatique : théorie et outils pour le traitement automatique des langues, qui s'est tenu en 1997 à Besançon, selon les conclusions rapportées par Claude Muller, Jean Royauté et Max Silberztein, dans leur ouvrage INTEX pour la linguistique et le traitement automatique des langues[74].\n",
      " Depuis 2008, Suissesse est le gentilé féminin recommandé par le ministère français des Affaires étrangères pour ses documents[75]. Dès 1993, l'arrêté du 4 novembre 1993 relatif à la terminologie des noms d'États et de capitales, pris conjointement par François Bayrou, ministre de l'Éducation nationale, et Alain Juppé, ministre des Affaires étrangères, précise, au huitième point de son article deux : « L’adjectif de nationalité est identique au nom des habitants. La Suisse fait exception à cette règle (nom féminin : Suissesse, adjectif féminin : suisse) »[76]. Ce terme est aussi repris par le gouvernement canadien pour ses documents officiels[77]. Le code de rédaction interinstitutionnel de l'Union Européenne le mentionne également[78].\n",
      " La population totale de la Suisse en 2021 s'élevait à 8,703 millions d'habitants[79] dont 4 221 943 femmes et 4 142 180 hommes ; 6 297 365 citoyens suisses et 2 066 758 étrangers (24,7 %)[80]. Parmi la population étrangère, 39 % résident en Suisse depuis 10 ans ou plus et 21 % sont nés en Suisse[81].\n",
      " Si on inclut la population étrangère non permanente dans le décompte, la Suisse compte 9 006 664 habitants le 30 juin 2023, dépassant pour la première fois la barre des 9 millions[82].\n",
      " En 2020, 2,77 millions d'immigrés de la première génération (80 %) et de descendants d'immigrés (20 %) vivaient en Suisse, soit 38 %[83] de la population résidente permanente[84].\n",
      " En 2020, l'espérance de vie à la naissance était de 85,1 ans[85] pour les femmes et 81 ans[86] pour les hommes pour une moyenne de 83,6 ans. Le taux de fécondité est remonté à 1,52[87] ; les Suisses ont un taux de 1,40 et les étrangères 1,86[88].\n",
      " Selon une étude de l'Observatoire suisse de la Santé (Obsan), un institut dépendant du Département fédéral de l'intérieur, environ 15 % de la population suisse souffre de troubles psychiques. La région lémanique ainsi que le Tessin sont davantage touchés par le problème selon la même étude[89].\n",
      " La croissance de la population suisse entre 2005 et 2010 devrait être de 0,4 %, l'indicateur conjoncturel de fécondité est prévu pour la même période à 1,42 enfants/femme, la mortalité infantile devrait être à 4,1 pour mille, l'espérance de vie des enfants nés et qui naîtront entre 2005 et 2010 sera 81,7 ans, la population urbaine constitue 75,2 %. Le nombre de médecins pour mille habitants est 3,8 ; l'espérance de scolarisation moyenne en année est à 15,3 ; 47 % des jeunes suivent une scolarisation au troisième degré[90].\n",
      " Selon des études officielles, Zurich, Saint-Gall, Genève et Bâle figurent parmi les dix villes européennes avec le plus fort taux de consommation de cocaïne et d'ecstasy[91].\n",
      " La Suisse est, après le Luxembourg, le deuxième pays d'Europe qui compte proportionnellement le plus de personnes issues de l'immigration (1re et 2e générations) parmi les personnes âgées de 25 à 54 ans. En 2020,il y avait 39 % d'immigrés (2'890'000)[92] et 15,3 % d'enfants d'au moins un immigré, soit un total de 46,4 %, loin devant la France (26,6 %), la Suède (25,8 %), l'Irlande (25,4 %), l'Autriche (25,3 %), le Royaume-Uni (24,4 %), les Pays-Bas (23,5 %), la Belgique (22,9 %), l'Allemagne (21,9 %) et l'Espagne (20,2 %)[93].\n",

      " La Suisse a quatre langues nationales : l'allemand (langue déclarée comme langue principale de 62,2 % de la population en 2018), le français (23 %), l'italien (8 %) et le romanche (0,5 %)[95],[96]. En 2018, les langues les plus parlées à la maison par les résidents permanents de 15 ans ou plus sont : le suisse allemand (59,4 %), le français (23,5 %), l'allemand standard (10,6 %), l'italien (8,5 %), l'anglais (5 %), le portugais (3,8 %), l'albanais (3 %), l'espagnol (2,6 %), le serbe ou croate (2,5 %), des dialectes tessinois (1,3 %) et le romanche (0,6 %). Enfin, 6,9 % de la population résidente parle une autre langue à la maison[97]. Au travail, environ 43 % de la population utilise plus d'une langue au moins une fois par semaine. Les langues les plus fréquemment parlées sur le lieu de travail en Suisse sont le suisse-allemand (64 % des personnes actives), l'allemand standard (35 %), le français (29 %), l'anglais (20 %) et l'italien (9 %)[98],[n 7].\n",
      " La Suisse est divisée en quatre zones linguistiques reconnues, en principe unilingues. Seuls quatre des vingt-six cantons sont plurilingues ; Berne, Fribourg et le Valais sont partagés entre la Suisse alémanique et la Suisse romande, tandis que les Grisons sont partagés entre 3 régions : alémanique, romanche et italienne. Les deux seules villes à être considérées officiellement comme bilingues français-allemand sont Bienne et Fribourg[99].\n",
      " L'administration fédérale suisse a l'obligation de communiquer toutes ses publications en allemand, français et italien, tandis que certaines d'entre elles sont également publiées en anglais et en romanche[100].\n",
      " Les termes propres à la Suisse, que ce soit en allemand, en français ou en italien, sont des helvétismes[101].\n",
      " Le suisse allemand est la langue la plus répandue en Suisse. Celle-ci est en réalité un regroupement de dialectes alémaniques et est utilisée dans l'ensemble de la Suisse alémanique pour les relations de tous les jours et pour tous les contextes, mais seulement à l'oral. Malgré des différences régionales notables, tous les pratiquants du suisse allemand se comprennent entre eux. Pour les échanges écrits formels, l'allemand standard est cependant préféré[102]. Au total, 17 cantons sur 26 sont unilingues allemands.\n",
      " La plupart des dialectes suisses allemands appartiennent au groupe du haut alémanique. Le dialecte de Bâle est le seul à avoir pour origine le bas alémanique, tandis que le dialecte de la vallée de Samnaun se rapproche de l'austro-bavarois[103]. L'enseignement dans une grande partie de la Suisse alémanique se fait en allemand standard[104].\n",
      " Le français de Suisse est parlé dans l'ouest du pays, région appelée Suisse romande, et diffère peu du français standard[102]. Quatre cantons sont unilingues français : Genève, Jura, Neuchâtel et Vaud.\n",
      " Jusqu'au début du xxe siècle, la majeure partie des Romands parlaient des dialectes ou patois[n 8] du francoprovençal, langue à part entière dont l'extension couvre la quasi-totalité de la Suisse romande, une large partie des régions françaises Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes et Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, l'essentiel du Val d'Aoste et huit vallées piémontaises. Ce rattachement à une langue autre que le français standard (d'oïl) explique en grande partie les nombreuses particularités linguistiques de la Suisse romande. Ces dialectes se sont largement éteints au cours du XXe siècle, mais sont encore parlés par la population âgée dans les cantons de Fribourg, du Valais et de Vaud[102]. Cette extinction explique l’évolution des anciens toponymes (Geneva, Losena, Nôchâtél, Fribôrg, etc.)[Quoi ?][106] vers ceux du français standard[réf. nécessaire].\n",
      " Dans le canton du Jura et dans le district bernois de Moutier, c'est le franc-comtois, un dialecte d'oïl, qui était la langue vernaculaire. Malgré l'appui institutionnel et le fait que le patois est inscrit dans la constitution jurassienne, le dialecte local est en voie de disparition[107].\n",
      " L'italien est parlé dans le sud du pays, dans la région généralement appelée Suisse italienne. On y retrouve plusieurs dialectes, qui sont utilisés lors de conversations familières[108].\n",
      " Le dialecte le plus répandu est le tessinois. Celui-ci s’apparente aux parlers lombards et fait partie du groupe gallo-italique. On retrouve également différents dialectes dans les vallées tessinoises, tous apparentés au lombard. Cependant, plus la région se trouve au nord, plus son dialecte a généralement de points communs avec d'autres dialectes alpins[108].\n",
      " Le romanche est une langue romane et la seule langue nationale à être unique à la Suisse. Elle est pratiquée par environ 60 000 personnes dans certaines régions du canton des Grisons[102]. Elle se compose de cinq dialectes : le sursilvan, le sutsilvan, le surmiran, le puter et le vallader. Ceux-ci se distinguent fortement par leur vocabulaire, leur prononciation et leur syntaxe, mais tous se comprennent entre eux. Au XXe siècle, le romanche a été standardisé sous l’appellation « rumantsch grischun », qui reprend les formes les plus courantes des dialectes afin de créer une langue uniformisée[109].\n",
      " Langue nationale depuis 1938, le romanche est présent sur le passeport et les billets de banque suisses et peut être utilisé pour des démarches administratives depuis 1996. Son usage est malgré tout limité. Seules quatre universités suisses enseignent le romanche, et seuls certains textes officiels sont traduits[110].\n",
      " L'anglais est souvent utilisé dans le monde du travail. Enfin, le latin sert parfois lorsqu'il faut désigner dans une seule langue des institutions suisses : Confœderatio helvetica (CH), Pro Helvetia, Pro Natura, Pro Infirmis, etc.\n",
      " La Suisse a ratifié la Charte européenne des langues régionales ou minoritaires en 1997 et a reconnu à ce titre le yéniche comme une langue nationale sans territoire[111].\n",
      " Les membres de l'Assemblée fédérale s'expriment dans leur langue maternelle. Les débats en plénum du Conseil national font l'objet d'une traduction simultanée, ce qui n'est pas le cas du Conseil des États ainsi que des commissions parlementaires.\n",
      " Selon le recensement fédéral de la population 2021[112], la religion la plus répandue du pays est le catholicisme, avec presque 32,9 % de la population. La deuxième religion est le protestantisme, avec 21,1 % de la population. Généralement, les cantons se réclament de l'une des deux confessions. Les autres communautés chrétiennes constituent 5,6 % de la population. Les communautés musulmanes en constituent 5,7 %. 0,2 % de la population appartient aux communautés juives. Les autres communautés religieuses se partagent les 1,3 % restants. En 2010, 40 000 à 50 000 alévis bektachis vivent en Suisse, la plupart étant d'origine turque[113][source insuffisante].\n",
      " La proportion des habitants se déclarant sans religion est de 32 % en 2023. Ce groupe a fortement augmenté ces dernières décennies, et est plutôt constitué de personnes jeunes et vivant en ville, dont certaines ont quitté leur communauté religieuse alors que d’autres n’en ont simplement jamais eu[114].\n",
      " Bénéficiant d'une réputation de sécurité, la Suisse connaît une évolution et se trouve dans les années 2010 au-dessus de la moyenne européenne en matière de cambriolages et d'actes de violence. La moitié des États européens enregistrerait pour ces délits un taux plus bas que la Suisse, alors qu'en 1984, celle-ci se trouvait encore en dernière position au niveau européen[115]. Le pays est également touché par un banditisme international. Des bandes spécialisées choisissent souvent la Suisse comme cible, encouragées en cela, selon le criminologue Martin Killias, par la clémence du droit pénal suisse[115].\n",
      " Les statistiques de la criminalité sont très variées selon les cantons, les cantons de Genève arrivant en tête en 2016 pour des vols par effraction avec un taux de 9,4 effractions pour 1 000 habitants (12 en 2015), devant Vaud 9,3 (9,9) et Bâle-Ville 8,8 (8,9) pour seulement 1,5 pour Appenzell Rhodes-Intérieures, 2,1 pour Uri et 2,5 pour Appenzell Rhodes-Extérieures, Lausanne et Genève étant en tête pour ce qui concerne les villes de plus de 30 000 habitants[116].\n",
      " Au 31 décembre 2012, la population étrangère représente 23,3 % de la population de la Suisse[117]. Dans un rapport de 2007, Doudou Diène, le Rapporteur spécial de l'ONU sur les formes contemporaines de racisme, de discrimination raciale, de xénophobie et de l'intolérance qui y est associée, a constaté une dynamique raciste et xénophobe en Suisse. Selon ce document, les étrangers européens du sud-est ainsi que les extra-européens seraient les plus touchés. Le Conseil fédéral a pris note du rapport et a déclaré « qu'on ne peut pas, à partir de cas particuliers, tirer des conclusions générales quant à l'existence « d'une dynamique de racisme et de xénophobie en Suisse » comme le dit le rapport de l'ONU[118] ». Une étude conduite en 2006 par l'université de Genève avec le soutien du FNS a toutefois révélé que plus de 50 % des personnes interrogées ont des idées xénophobes[119]. Même si 90 % n'approuvent pas l'extrémisme de droite, 77 % voudraient que les étrangers soient mieux intégrés et 55 % voudraient une naturalisation facilitée. Dans certains cantons, le droit de vote est accordé aux étrangers sur les plans communal et cantonal. La disposition constitutionnelle leur donne parfois même le droit d'éligibilité.\n",
      " L'économie suisse figure parmi les plus prospères et les plus développées du monde[123] bien que la Suisse soit très pauvre en matières premières et ne dispose pas d'énergies fossiles. Orientée vers les services avec les banques et les assurances, le tourisme, le transport, ainsi que vers l'industrie avec notamment la mécanique de précision et des spécialités industrielles, le pays produit surtout des biens à forte valeur ajoutée.\n",
      " Selon le Global Competitiveness Report 2011-2012 du forum économique mondial, la Suisse est le 19e pays industriel au monde au regard de sa production annuelle (100 milliards de dollars en 2010) et la plus forte production industrielle par habitant au monde avec 12 400 $ de production industrielle par habitant[124]. Le niveau de vie est l'un des plus élevés du monde. De plus, sa stabilité et sa neutralité ont attiré bon nombre de capitaux étrangers et d'organisations internationales comme l'ONU.\n",
      " Le secteur tertiaire représentait en 2005 72,4 % du PIB et 295 622 entreprises, il emploie 72,5 % de la population active ; en 1960, il en occupait 40 %[125].\n",
      " Le secteur secondaire représentait en 2005 26,3 % du PIB (18 % du PIB de l'UE en 2006) et 76 927 entreprises, il emploie 23,7 % de la population active (17,9 % dans l'UE) ; en 1960, il occupait 25 % de la population environ[125].\n",
      " Le secteur primaire représentait en 2005 1,3 % du PIB et 68 050 entreprises, il emploie 3,8 % de la population active ; en 1960, il occupait 15 % de la population environ[125].\n",
      " Après plusieurs années de croissance nulle ou faible[126], une reprise s'est fait ressentir dès mi-2003. En 2004 la croissance du PIB est de 2,5 %, puis 2,6 % en 2006. En 2006 et 2007 elle passe à 3,6 %. Durant le premier semestre 2008, le PIB n'augmente que modestement puis fléchit au deuxième semestre. À cause de l'effet de base, la croissance est de 1,9 %, chiffre à relativiser étant donné la forte croissance démographique (+1,3 %). La Suisse a mieux résisté à la récession de 2008-2009 que d'autres pays. Le creux, atteint au deuxième trimestre 2009, a vu un recul total du PIB de 2,7 %, un taux bien inférieur au Japon (−8,6 %), l'Allemagne (−6,7 %), l'Italie (−6,5 %), le Royaume-Uni (−5,8 %), les États-Unis (−3,8 %) ou la France (−3,5 %)[127]. En 2009, le PIB s'établit à 535,3 milliards de francs suisses[128]. L'inflation est relativement faible : entre mai 1993 et avril 2010, le renchérissement annuel moyen se chiffre à 0,9 %[129]. La dette des collectivités publiques en 2011 se situe à 36,5 % du PIB[130]. En 2014, la croissance annuelle était de 1,9 %.\n",
      " Le 15 janvier 2015, la banque nationale suisse décide de laisser flotter le franc suisse face à l'euro avec pour conséquence de faire monter la monnaie helvétique de 1,20 CHF pour 1 € à 0,97 CHF pour 1 € ce qui provoque un ralentissement du PIB (-0,3 % au premier trimestre, +0,2 % au deuxième trimestre et 0 % au troisième trimestre), soit une baisse de 0,2 % par habitant. Les exportations de biens baissent et un tiers des entreprises du secteur de l'industrie des biens d'équipement devraient faire face à une perte opérationnelle. Les Suisses dépensent massivement leurs francs hors des frontières nationales et le « tourisme frontalier » augmente de 8 % en 2015[131].\n",
      " Le taux de chômage, bien que variable selon les cantons, se maintient à un niveau très bas (3,7 % en 2009, 2,8 % en juin 2011 et 3,1 % en juin 2015, 3,4 % en janvier 2016)[132], le plus bas en Europe mais le nombre des demandeurs d'emploi, 158 629 personnes en décembre 2015, est à son plus haut niveau depuis avril 2010. Ce taux de chômage néanmoins très faible peut s'expliquer par une valorisation de l'apprentissage. En effet, deux tiers des plus de quinze ans font le choix de ce système de formation[133],[134],[135].\n",
      " Le 14 septembre 2020, lors de la pandémie de coronavirus, l'Union syndicale suisse a appelé à une augmentation de salaire jusqu'à 100 francs par mois ou jusqu'à 2 % dans les succursales et entreprises pour améliorer la situation de leurs travailleurs[136], en 2022, elle affirme qu'il ne devrait plus y avoir de salaires inférieurs à 4500 francs au sein de la fédération[137].\n",
      " Le 20 octobre 2020, selon le Centre de Recherches Conjoncturelles, la contraction de l'économie suisse due à la pandémie de Covid-19 s'avère plus faible qu'initialement prévu en juin 2020[138].\n",
      " Les villes de Genève et de Zurich sont chaque année classées dans le top 10 des villes les plus chères au monde[139],[140],[141].\n",
      " Cette liste est celle des cantons suisses classés selon la valeur de leur produit intérieur brut (PIB) annuel, en valeur nominale, par tête en Francs suisses en 2018 selon l'Office fédéral de la statistique[142] :\n",
      " La Suisse n'est pas autosuffisante sur le plan énergétique. En 2006, 85 % de l'énergie finale consommée dans le pays provient d'importations : produits pétroliers, gaz naturel ou combustible nucléaire. La principale source d'énergie indigène est l'énergie hydraulique. Elle fournit plus de la moitié de l'électricité produite dans le pays. Les autres sources d'énergies indigènes sont le bois, les déchets industriels et les autres énergies renouvelables (géothermie, énergie éolienne, énergie solaire, etc.). La production d'électricité est principalement assurée par des installations hydroélectriques et des centrales nucléaires.\n",
      " En mai 2011, à la suite des accidents de Fukushima, le Conseil fédéral avait ordonné l'abandon total de l'énergie atomique pour 2034. Les électeurs suisses ayant rejeté en novembre 2016 à 54,23 % une initiative des Verts, proposant de limiter à 45 ans la durée de vie d'un réacteur, le conseil fédéral devra repousser l'échéance à 2050.\n",
      " Le 21 mai 2017, les Suisses votent par référendum, à 58,2 %, pour la sortie progressive du nucléaire et le développement des énergies renouvelables. Tous les partis apportent leur soutien sauf l'UDC, estimant que le coût de la transition serait trop élevé. Si la loi interdit la construction de nouvelles centrales, les centrales existantes pourront toutefois subsister tant que leur sûreté sera garantie[143],[144].\n",
      " Les compétences des autorités fédérales suisses sont limitées en ce qui concerne l'école obligatoire, comprenant le primaire et le secondaire pour la partie qui concerne des élèves jusqu'à 16 ans. Dans ces secteurs, il est en conséquence peu approprié de parler d'un système éducatif suisse. En effet, même si des tentatives d'harmonisation ont d'ores et déjà abouti, avec notamment le projet HarmoS, il est légitime de considérer que la Suisse compte 26 systèmes éducatifs, soit un par canton. Cette règle du partage des compétences sur l'instruction se retrouve, depuis la constitution suisse de 1874, en particulier dans les quatre alinéas de l'article 27[145].\n",
      " Concernant l'enseignement supérieur, l'offre de formation en Suisse est très importante. Elle se divise principalement en deux domaines : celui des hautes écoles et celui de la formation professionnelle supérieure.\n",
      " Le domaine des hautes écoles comprend les hautes écoles universitaires (universités cantonales et Écoles polytechniques fédérales) ainsi que les hautes écoles spécialisées et les écoles supérieures. Le domaine de la formation professionnelle supérieure est constitué par toutes les autres formations de degré tertiaire préparant au brevet fédéral ou au diplôme fédéral. La formation professionnelle supérieure se caractérise par une offre large et diversifiée d'institutions privées.\n",
      " Il y a au total 12 universités en Suisse, parmi lesquelles dix sont gérées au niveau cantonal et proposent souvent des sujets non techniques.\n",
      " La plus ancienne université en Suisse fut fondée à Bâle en 1460 (faculté de médecine). Elle est devenue un centre de recherche en chimie et en médecine, mais en raison de son héritage intellectuel d'Érasme de Rotterdam au XVe siècle, l'université est généralement aussi comptée parmi l'un des lieux de naissance de l'humanisme de la Renaissance[146]. L'université de Zurich constitue le plus grand campus du pays avec environ 25 000 étudiants[147].\n",
      " Les deux écoles polytechniques qui sont gérées par la confédération sont l'EPFL (fondée en 1853) et l'EPFZ (fondée en 1855). Elles jouissent toutes les deux d'une excellente réputation internationale.\n",
      " Le CERN, situé près de Genève, à la frontière franco-suisse, est le premier centre mondial de recherche en physique des particules[148]. Un autre centre de recherche important est l'Institut Paul Scherrer.\n",
      " Parmi les inventions et découvertes notables se trouvent le LSD (par le chimiste Albert Hofmann), le microscope à effet tunnel (prix Nobel) ou le très populaire velcro. Quelques technologies ont en outre permis l'exploration de nouveaux mondes, comme le ballon pressurisé d'Auguste Piccard ou le bathyscaphe qui permettra à Jacques Piccard d'atteindre l'endroit le plus profond du globe.\n",
      " Un grand nombre de prix Nobel a été attribué à des scientifiques suisses, par exemple au mondialement célèbre Albert Einstein dans le domaine de la physique. Au total, pas moins de 113 prix Nobel sont associés, directement ou indirectement, à la Suisse ainsi qu'à des organisations internationales basées en Suisse[149].\n",
      " En 2023, la Suisse est classée en 1re position pour l'indice mondial de l'innovation[150].\n",
      " La Suisse est l'un des dix membres fondateurs de l'Agence spatiale européenne (ESA), en 1975[151]. Elle est le septième plus grand contributeur au budget de l'ESA. Dans le secteur privé, quelques entreprises sont impliquées dans l'industrie spatiale telles qu'Oerlikon Space[152] et Maxon Motors[153] qui fournissent des structures pour véhicules spatiaux.\n",
      " Chaque habitant qui est établi en Suisse a l'obligation d'être couvert par une assurance maladie, ainsi qu'une assurance accident. Le système de santé suisse est en 2018 classé meilleur d'Europe, notamment avec des délais courts et un accès direct aux spécialistes[154].\n",
      " Par sa position géographique au centre de l'Europe, la Suisse possède l'un des réseaux routier et de chemin de fer les plus denses du monde, noté le meilleur d'Europe selon le European Railway Performance Index[155] (5 053 km de voies ferrées et 71 059 km de routes revêtues, dont 1 638 km d'autoroutes).\n",
      " La traversée des Alpes constitue un enjeu important pour les transports européens puisque les Alpes (qui recouvrent une bonne partie du pays) séparent l'Italie du reste de l'Europe. Depuis l'industrialisation des pays européens, la Suisse améliore son réseau transalpin : tunnel ferroviaire du Saint-Gothard de 15 km en 1882, tunnel ferroviaire du Simplon de 20 km en 1906, tunnel routier du Grand-Saint-Bernard de 6 km en 1964, tunnel routier du San Bernardino de 7 km en 1967, tunnel routier du Saint-Gothard de 17 km en 1980, tunnel ferroviaire de base du Lötschberg de 34 km en 2007, tunnel ferroviaire de base du Saint-Gothard de 57 km en 2016.\n",
      " Le transport ferroviaire international du pays s'élevait en 2008 à 9 766 millions de tonnes-kilomètres, ce qui représente le cinquième de la quantité totale transportée de cette manière en Europe (CEE + Norvège + Suisse)[156]. La majorité du réseau ferré est géré par les Chemins de fer fédéraux suisses (CFF). Le Chemin de fer du Lötschberg, qui exploite le deuxième réseau ferroviaire suisse sur l'axe Suisse centrale - Italie via les tunnels du Lötschberg et du Simplon, ainsi que les chemins de fer rhétiques, qui desservent le canton des Grisons en voies étroites, sont deux compagnies privées importantes. Il y a en outre une multitude de petites entreprises privées.\n",
      " Le réseau routier est public, sauf le tunnel du Grand-Saint-Bernard. Une vignette annuelle permet d'utiliser les autoroutes nationales.\n",
      " Sur le plan du transport aérien, la Suisse possède 39 aérodromes, dont les aéroports internationaux de Zurich (23 millions de passagers par an), Genève (16 millions), Bâle/Mulhouse (7 millions), de Berne (200 000), de Sion en Suisse romande et de Lugano pour la Suisse italienne[157].\n",
      " En 2012, la Banque nationale suisse détient des réserves en euros pratiquement équivalentes à la moitié de celles cumulées des 17 banques centrales nationales de la zone euro. La Suisse se situe au cinquième rang des plus importantes réserves en devises étrangères détenues par des États, derrière la Chine, le Japon, l'Arabie saoudite et la Russie[158].\n",
      " La Suisse est souvent considérée comme l'un des plus grands paradis financiers au monde : en 2013, selon les estimations de Boston Consulting Group, la Confédération est le premier centre financier offshore mondial avec 1 600 milliards d'euros d'avoirs[159]. Le pays représente 4,5 % des flux financiers internationaux et figure à la première place du classement des paradis fiscaux établi par l'ONG Tax Justice Network[160].\n",
      " En mars 2023, le sauvetage en urgence du Crédit suisse, piloté par le gouvernement, est rendu nécessaire par éviter une déstabilisation des places financières mondiales[161]. Les conditions de sa mise en œuvre provoquent une vive émotion[162] et font l'objet de nombreuses contestations en justice  de la part d'investisseurs professionnels et particuliers[163].\n",
      " Le tourisme représente 2,4 % du produit national brut de la Suisse. Dans les cantons de montagne des Grisons, d'Appenzell Rhodes-Intérieures, du Valais et d'Obwald, plus de 10 % de la main-d'œuvre est cependant employée dans ce secteur[164]. L'enseignement à l'École hôtelière de Lausanne, établissement-phare du pays, en tient compte: le développement durable est un secteur d’avenir dans le tourisme, selon Peter Varga, professeur en « culture durable de l’accueil », selon qui les professionnels suisse « sont friands de profils qui peuvent les accompagner dans la réduction de leur empreinte carbone ». Ce professeur estime nécessaire un « label gouvernemental permettant d’identifier les hôtels qui ont réduit leurs émissions ». L'enseignement à l'École hôtelière de Lausanne a aussi pour particularité de sensibiliser au green nudge (« coup de pouce vert »), qui consiste à inciter aux « comportements écologiques d’une manière ludique »[165].\n",
      " La Suisse est une « championne cachée » de la durabilité, selon Martin Nydegger, le directeur général de Suisse Tourisme, organisme mandaté par le gouvernement pour promouvoir le pays et lancer un label de durabilité estiné à toutes les entreprises de la branche touristique[166]. Ce label classe les établissements en trois catégories en fonction de leur degré de durabilité.\n",
      " Les sources universitaires se sont intéressées à la manière dont la Suisse avait promu une forme de tourisme durable, basée sur la pureté du décor montagnard, mais aussi assez élitiste, en raison de l'époque, le tourisme durable étant encore considéré comme tel, pour les sports d'hiver ou dits « de glisse » : ski, patinage, luge. Cette pionnière dans ce domaine en Europe a ensuite fait école. Une exposition d’affiches anciennes de stations de villégiature suisses, organisée au Musée des arts et métiers de Zurich, rééditées par l’éditeur Photoglob (Zurich), a permis de dater du début du XXe siècle la promotion du tourisme hivernal pour Davos et Saint-Moritz, au début des années 1930 pour Zermatt et à partir de 1940 pour Crans-Montana. Ces stations ont aussi beaucoup utilisées des cartes postales vendues dans les kiosques des gares pour mettre en avant un caractère mondain, élitiste, dans des points de vente standardisés. Les personnages figurant les « montagnards » sont représentés uniquement sur les affiches faisant la promotion de la saison estivale de Saint-Moritz, sous les traits de jeunes femmes souriantes, vêtues de tenues « traditionnelles »[167].\n",
      " Les cartes postales ont joué ainsi un rôle dans la création de la « montagnité », imaginaire se voulant être le plus représentatif possible des espaces montagnards, et écartant les signes des différents villages d'accueil, y compris dans les stations françaises : sur 478 vendues à Megève, dominent les vues d’ensemble qui présentent le mont Blanc en arrière-plan, alors que le mont Joly et le mont d’Arbois, emblématiques du développement des sports d’hiver à Megève avec le téléphérique de Rochebrune mis en service en 1933, et l’hôtel du Mont d’Arbois créé par la famille Rothschild, apparaissent beaucoup moins[167].\n",
      " La Suisse, par sa situation géographique et son histoire, est imprégnée des cultures latines et germaniques ; les coutumes locales cohabitent selon les régions linguistiques du pays. En effet, le pays possède quatre langues nationales (l'allemand (64 %), le français (20 %), l'italien (6 %) et le romanche (<1 %)). Cette diversité culturelle, essentielle pour la cohésion du pays, participe de l'identité de la Suisse[168].\n",
      " L'hymne national suisse officiel depuis 1981 est le Cantique suisse, composé en 1841 par Alberich Zwyssig (1808-1854) sur des paroles de Leonhard Widmer (1809-1867)[169].\n",
      " Au XVIIe siècle, la Confédération ne possédait pas encore de représentation symbolique forte. Mais au cours du siècle suivant, Helvetia et Guillaume Tell sont élevés au rang de symboles patriotiques suisses. À partir de 1848, Helvetia est élevée au rang d'emblème national du nouvel État fédéral. Ce symbole devient alors omniprésent, que ce soit sous la forme d'œuvre d'art, sur les monuments, sur les timbres ou sur les monnaies[170].\n",
      " Un certain nombre de mythes et de légendes sont associés aux épisodes anciens de l'histoire suisse.\n",
      " La notion de protection du patrimoine apparaît dès la fin du XIXe siècle. Par ailleurs, sept sites culturels font partie du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO : la vieille ville de Berne, l'Abbaye de Saint-Gall, le Couvent bénédictin Saint-Jean-des-Sœurs, les trois châteaux de Bellinzone, le vignoble de Lavaux[171], le Chemin de fer rhétique dans le paysage de l'Albula et de la Bernina et l'urbanisme horloger des villes de La Chaux-de-Fonds et du Locle.\n",
      " De nombreux châteaux forts et fortifications du Moyen Âge sont construits par les familles dynastiques. Ils servent à la fois d'habitation et de moyen de défense. Mentionnons quelques châteaux forts : le château de Chillon, Lenzbourg, Mesocco, Berthoud, Kybourg ou les trois châteaux de Bellinzone. Les villes du Moyen Âge sont fortifiées. Certaines d'entre elles, comme Morat, sont préservées et ont conservé leurs remparts. Mais, dans la plupart des cas, seuls subsistent des vestiges au cœur des villes comme la Zeitturm de Zoug, la porte de Spalen à Bâle ou la Zytglogge de Berne.\n",
      " Des bâtiments religieux apparaissent dès le VIe siècle. Couvents, monastères, églises et cathédrales sont bâtis, parmi lesquels on peut mentionner le couvent de Saint-Gall, l'abbaye d'Einsiedeln, l'abbaye de Saint-Maurice, la cathédrale de Bâle, l'Abbatiale de Romainmôtier et la cathédrale de Lausanne[172].\n",
      " On trouve des édifices publics dont certains remontent à la période romaine, comme l'amphithéâtre d'Avenches, mais aussi des hôtels de ville, le plus ancien étant celui de Berne (1406)[173]. L'hôtel de ville de Bâle (1504 – 1514), avec ses façades de couleur rouge, est très caractéristique. La tour carrée dans la cour de l'hôtel de ville de Genève (1555) est un bâtiment typique de la Renaissance de tradition française en pierre de taille. Au XIXe siècle, de nouveaux bâtiments publics voient le jour comme les postes, les gares, les musées, les théâtres, les églises et les écoles. Citons le palais fédéral, la gare centrale de Zurich, le musée national suisse, le grand Théâtre de Genève et l'université de Zurich.\n",
      " La Suisse compte quelques ensembles urbains remarquables. La vieille ville de Berne, avec ses arcades, places et fontaines, est représentative de l'urbanisme médiéval en Europe. À la fin du XIXe siècle, les quartiers neufs naissent sur l'emplacement des anciennes fortifications des grandes villes, comme la Bahnhofstrasse de Zurich, la Ceinture fazyste de Genève ou le quartier St. Alban à Bâle[ca 1]. C'est également dans cette période que de nouvelles synagogues sont construites dans les quartiers neufs des grandes villes du pays : Genève (1859), Bâle (1866) et Zurich (1884). L'urbanisme devient planifié : en 1834, La Chaux-de-Fonds, qui est détruite par un incendie, sera reconstruite selon une nouvelle structure urbaine[ca 2] (voir Ensemble urbain du XIXe siècle de La Chaux-de-Fonds). Au début du XXe siècle sont créés des logements ouvriers basés sur le modèle du Werkbund, comme le lotissement Freidorf (1919 – 1921) à Muttenz, synthèse entre l'idéal de la cité-jardin et le mouvement coopératif[175]. Des cités satellites sont construites dans les banlieues des grandes villes durant la période entre 1945 et 1975, comme Le Lignon en périphérie de Genève[ca 3].\n",
      " À partir du XVe siècle, les maisons civiles de style gothique en pierre apparaissent, par exemple, le Grimmenturm de la Spiegelgasse à Zurich, la maison Tavel à Genève, la Haus zum Rüden[176] à Zurich, la Haus zum Ritter à Schaffhouse, l'hôtel Ratzé (1583-1586) à Fribourg et la maison Serodine (1620) à Ascona[177]. Pendant la Renaissance, des arcades sont ouvertes au Tessin comme dans la cour du château de Muralto, l'ancien Palazzo Rusca à Lugano et le Collegio Papio à Ascona[ms 1]. En Suisse allemande, le premier bâtiment de style renaissance est le « palais Ritter » (1556) à Lucerne.\n",
      " Les maisons particulières baroques sont richement décorées avec des encorbellements à un ou plusieurs étages, comme à Schaffhouse, et possèdent des oriels en pierre ou en bois comme à Saint-Gall. À titre d'exemple, le Herrenstube et le Frontwagenturm à Schaffhouse. À Zurich, deux maisons de corporation sont construites en pierres de taille et présentent un aspect sévère : Zimmerleuten (1708) et Saffran (1719 – 1723)[ms 2]. L'ouest du pays est plus influencé par l'architecture baroque française ; ce style s'impose en Suisse romande vers la fin du XVIIe siècle. Il en va ainsi des hôtels particuliers de la rue des Granges, à Genève, avec cour d'honneur[178]. On trouve aussi des exemples de style rococo[ms 3]. Parmi les bâtiments les plus importants pour l'architecture néo-baroque en Suisse se trouvent la cathédrale Saint-Ours et Saint-Victor à Soleure (1769) et l'Opéra de Zurich (1891). La ville de Soleure est généralement considérée comme « la plus belle ville baroque de Suisse »[174].\n",
      " À partir de 1800, de grandes villas classicistes sont conçues, comme le palais Eynard (1817-1821) à Genève ou la Villa Merian (1801) à Bâle/Münchenstein. Plus tard, au XXe siècle apparaissent quelques réalisations d'architecture moderne : la villa Le Lac (1923) et l'immeuble Clarté (1931) à Genève par Le Corbusier, ou la Cité Halen (1957-1961) par l'Atelier 5, près de Berne, un exemple de maisons individuelles contiguës en terrasse pour la classe moyenne[ca 4]. Mais on constate également encore la construction de plusieurs bâtiments dans le style de la Belle Époque, comme le Beau-Rivage Palace de Lausanne ou le siège de Swiss Re à Zurich en 1913.\n",
      " La forte diversité des espaces naturels en Suisse se retrouve dans la grande variété de maisons rustiques, qui se déclinent selon diverses variétés alpines : les Gotthardhaus (maisons du Gothard), en bois, trouvées dans les vallées alpines isolées du Tessin, du Valais et dans les Grisons ; la maison valaisanne, en bois, typique du centre du Valais et du Val d'Hérens ; la maison tessinoise, en moellons ; la maison engadinoise décorée de peintures murales et de Sgraffite[ms 4],[mh 1] ; les maisons de l'Oberland bernois et Simmental, en bois massif travaillé à la scie, Strickbau ou en madriers carrés, taillés à la hache[179].\n",
      " Sur le plateau suisse, la maison bernoise, recouverte d'une énorme toiture en croupe avec des charpentes agrémentées de motifs sculptés[ms 5],[180] ; les chaumières argoviennes[181] ; les maisons à colombage sur le plateau oriental et à Zurich ; les fermes à usages multiples (Dreisässenhäuser) au nord-ouest et sur le plateau romand, construites en pierre[182],[ms 5].\n",
      " Dans le Jura, les fermes jurassiennes possèdent de larges façades pignon entièrement en pierre crépie à la chaux[ms 4],[mh 2],[183].\n",
      " Les ouvrages d'arts tels que ponts et tunnels sont nombreux. Le Pont du Diable au cœur des Alpes sur la route du col du Saint-Gothard ou le Mittlere Brücke sur le Rhin à Bâle en sont des exemples historiques. Beaucoup de ponts médiévaux sont en bois comme le Kapellbrücke à Lucerne. Au XIXe siècle, des ponts suspendus à l'aide de câbles d'acier sont construits à Genève (pont de Saint-Antoine) et à Fribourg (Grand Pont). En 1834, à l'époque de sa construction, ce dernier était le plus long du genre[184],[ca 2]. De nombreux ponts et tunnels pour les chemins de fer comme le viaduc de Landwasser, les tunnels du Gothard et du Simplon sont construits au tournant du XXe siècle[ca 5]. Le pont de Salginatobel ou le viaduc de Chillon sont des ouvrages routiers du XXe siècle.\n",
      " La plupart des fêtes sont locales ou régionales, certaines fêtes sont célébrées dans toute la Suisse comme la fête nationale suisse, le Jeûne fédéral (à part Genève et dans les cantons catholiques) ou les principales fêtes religieuses. Différentes fêtes fédérales sont également trouvées avec notamment des rassemblements associatifs dénotant un caractère patriotique plus ou moins prononcé selon l'époque, ce sont des concours ayant lieu tous les trois ans environ[185].\n",
      " La fête nationale suisse est célébrée le 1er août. C'est un jour férié officiel dans toute la Suisse depuis 1994 seulement. Les jours fériés en Suisse sont de la compétence des cantons, qui déterminent eux-mêmes leur propres jours fériés, jusqu'à huit dans l'année. Légalement, les jours fériés sont assimilés à des dimanches. Les jours fériés varient donc beaucoup d'un canton à l'autre. Seuls Noël, le Nouvel An, le Jeudi de l'Ascension et le 1er août sont communs à tous, les autres fêtes (le 2 janvier Saint-Berthold, Vendredi saint, le Lundi de Pâques, le Lundi de Pentecôte, Fête-Dieu, Assomption, Jeûne fédéral, Toussaint, Immaculée Conception et le 26 décembre) étant reconnues par les cantons selon leur tradition principalement religieuse (catholique ou protestante). Seule la fête nationale, le 1er août, est ancrée dans la constitution fédérale[186].\n",
      " Les jeux nationaux, qui se pratiquent notamment lors de fêtes fédérales ou cantonales, sont la lutte suisse, le lancer de la pierre et le Hornuss. La pratique du tir est élevée au rang de sport national. En plus des obligations de tir prévues dans le cadre du service militaire, donc de nombreuses fêtes de tir lors de fêtes locales, cantonales et fédérales. Parmi d'autres jeux traditionnellement pratiqués en Suisse, il existe le Jass, très populaire, le Eisstock et les combats de reines.\n",
      " La musique populaire suisse « typique » rurale n'est pas exclusivement suisse. Les traditions telles que le « Chant du soir », les « Ranz des vaches » ou le « yodel » se retrouvent dans d'autres régions alpines ; des pièces variées, autant par la langue utilisée (allemand, français ou italien) que par le genre d'histoire racontée[187].\n",
      " La Suisse a, depuis des siècles, une grande tradition de carnavals agrémentés de groupes musicaux avec leur style propre : les cliques et les groupes de Guggenmusik et de brass band. Les carnavals les plus connus sont ceux de Bâle, de Lucerne, de Soleure, de Fribourg, de Monthey et celui de Bellinzone. Les Brandons de Payerne est un des plus anciens carnavals de Suisse[188]. La musique folklorique jouée lors de fêtes traditionnelles comprend notamment le yodel. Lors de la fête fédérale des yodleurs, le cor des Alpes est également joué. Le ranz des vaches est le chant traditionnel a cappella des armaillis (vachers) dans le canton de Fribourg. Il est habituellement chanté durant la montée des troupeaux à l'alpage et le retour dans les étables à la fin de l'été.\n",
      " Il y a peu de plats nationaux. Les nombreuses spécialités locales reflètent la diversité linguistique et géographique de la Suisse. Les traditions culinaires d'origine paysannes proposent des plats robustes et riches en calories, justifiés en partie par la nature montagneuse de la Suisse avec ses hivers longs et rudes[189]. Les plats représentatifs du pays sont les röstis ainsi que ses repas traditionnels au fromage comme la fondue au fromage et la raclette. Parmi les spécialités locales connues dans l'ensemble du pays, on trouve les Basler Läckerlis, la tarte aux noix des Grisons, la tourte au Kirsch de Zoug, l'émincé de veau à la zurichoise, le gratin de cardons genevois, le totché jurassien, la taillaule neuchâteloise, le papet vaudois ainsi que la polenta et le risotto à la tessinoise.\n",
      " Les produits typiques sont le chocolat dont les variantes au lait et fondant ont été créées respectivement par Daniel Peter en 1875 et Rudolf Lindt en 1879 ; de nombreuses formes de fromages tels que l'Emmental, le Gruyère, L'Etivaz, la raclette, le Sbrinz, la Tête de moine, le vacherin fribourgeois ou le vacherin Mont d'Or[190] ; la viticulture, principalement concentrée à l'ouest et au sud du pays ; ainsi que de nombreuses variétés de saucisses et viande séchée comme le cervelas, le saucisson vaudois, la viande séchée du Valais, la viande des Grisons ou des salamis tels que le Salametto. Certains produits alimentaires comme les aromates en poudre (Knorr[191] et les cubes de bouillon Maggi), le Rivella et l'Ovomaltine sont des classiques fabriqués de longue date. Le Cenovis à base végétale et le Parfait sont des pâtes à tartiner très connues de la Suisse[192].\n",
      " « La culture est du ressort des cantons »[193]. Néanmoins, « la Confédération peut promouvoir les activités culturelles présentant un intérêt national et encourager l’expression artistique et musicale, en particulier par la promotion de la formation »[194]. La part du budget de la Confédération affecté à la culture est faible : 0,3 % du total. En chiffre cela représente environ 200 millions de francs suisses. Celle des cantons est variable en fonction de leur importance. À titre d'exemple, les budgets cantonaux de Zurich (322 millions de francs suisses en 2002), et Genève (234 millions), sont même plus élevés que la part de la Confédération. Les entreprises privées contribuent pour 320 millions de francs suisses[195]. Au niveau fédéral, l'Office fédéral de la culture (OFC) a pour mission de favoriser la diversité de la culture et de préserver son développement en toute indépendance.\n",
      " L'organisme Présence Suisse promeut l'image de la Suisse à l'étranger. Dans le cadre de la culture il travaille avec Pro Helvetia[196],[197]. Pro Helvetia est une fondation fédérale dont les tâches concernent principalement la création contemporaine. Pro Helvetia possède quatre bureaux de liaison à l'étranger et gère également les centres culturels suisses[198]. Dans le cadre de la protection du patrimoine, la Confédération publie quatre inventaires : l'inventaire fédéral des sites construits à protéger en Suisse, l'inventaire fédéral des paysages, sites et monuments naturels d'importance nationale, l'inventaire des voies de communication historiques de la Suisse[199] et l'inventaire suisse des biens culturels d'importance nationale et régionale à protéger en cas de catastrophe[200].\n",
      " Le mécénat est une forme de financement de la culture en Suisse pratiqué par les grandes entreprises, notamment les banques et assurances. L'aide va surtout aux grandes institutions au détriment des acteurs culturels indépendants. Elle prend la forme d'achat ou de commande d'œuvre ainsi que l'organisation de manifestations propres (concours ou expositions)[201].\n",
      " \n",
      "Le pour-cent culturel Migros est un mode de financement volontaire de la culture en Suisse par la Migros, mis en place dès 1957[202]. Parmi d'autres organisations de protection du patrimoine on peut citer la Cinémathèque suisse, le Patrimoine suisse et Pro Natura. En 2021, la Suisse comptait 1 081 musées, qui ont totalisé 10,3 millions d'entrées cette année-là[203]. Un tiers sont des établissements régionaux ou locaux. En 2015, 71,4 % se trouvent en Suisse alémanique, 20,3 % en Suisse romande et 8,3 % en Suisse italienne[204]. Entre 1998 et 2015, il y a eu une augmentation de 200 musées, et leur nombre était trois fois moins important en 1950[205].\n",
      " Entre 2015 et 2021, il y a eu un baisse de 30 musées et les entrées au musées ont également baissé, passant de 12,9 à 10,3 millions d'entrées[203].\n",
      " Les principaux musées des beaux-arts sont le Kunstmuseum de Bâle (plus ancien musée d'art accessible au public au monde)[206], le Kunstmuseum de Berne[207] et le Kunsthaus de Zurich[208]. Art contemporain : le Musée d'Art contemporain de Bâle (premier lieu d’exposition public en Europe exclusivement consacré à la production et à la pratique d’art contemporain) et le musée d'Art moderne et contemporain (MAMCO)[209]. Collections privées : le Centre Paul-Klee à Berne, le Musée Tinguely à Bâle, la Fondation Beyeler à Riehen[210] et la Fondation Gianadda à Martigny. La Collection de l'art brut est un musée consacré à l'art brut, situé dans la ville vaudoise de Lausanne.\n",
      " Les Musées nationaux suisses dépendent de l'Office fédéral de la culture. Ils regroupent huit musées répartis dans différentes régions de la Suisse dont le principal est le musée national suisse de Zurich. Des musées présentant l'histoire : le musée des chartes fédérales (1936) à Schwytz[211],[212] et le musée international de la Réforme à Genève. Autres thèmes : le musée suisse des transports de Lucerne, le musée olympique à Lausanne, le musée international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge à Genève, la Fondation Martin Bodmer à Cologny et le Musée suisse de l'habitat rural du Ballenberg.\n",
      " Des foires et expositions ont lieu régulièrement, comme Art Basel, l'une des plus importantes foires d'art contemporain du monde avec près de 300 galeries représentées[213]. Les expositions nationales suisses sont des expositions ayant lieu tous les vingt-cinq ans environ depuis 1883. Leur but de rassembler et de répondre aux attentes socio-politiques des visiteurs autour de thèmes choisis. Elles sont ainsi le « miroir » de la société suisse à un moment donné. Parmi les salles de spectacle d'importance on peut citer le Schauspielhaus de Zurich (compté parmi les théâtres les plus importants du monde germanophone) et le Theater Basel à Bâle (nommé « théâtre de l'année » en 2009, 2012 et 2018 par le journal berlinois « Opernwelt »)[214] pour le théâtre ; le Grand Théâtre à Genève et l'Opéra de Zurich pour l'opéra ; le Victoria Hall de Genève et la Tonhalle de Zurich pour la musique classique. Des salles sont polyvalentes et se destinent à des événements d'ampleur régionale, voire nationale, tels que l'Aréna de Genève, l'Auditorium Stravinski de Montreux[215] ou le Palais de la culture et des congrès de Lucerne. Martigny accueille chaque année depuis 1960 la Foire du Valais recueillant plus de 200 000 personnes sur une dizaine de jours et avec ses 221 700 visiteurs en 2015, elle est devenue la foire la plus fréquentée de Suisse romande.Elle se démarque des autres foires par son ambiance très festive.\n",
      " Certains lieux publics, dont la fonction première n'est pas le spectacle scénique, reçoivent les événements rassemblant de nombreux spectateurs, tels que l'ancien aérodrome de Dübendorf qui a reçu les spectacles de Madonna (2008) et des Rolling Stones (2006)[216] ou des stades comme le Hallenstadion de Zurich. De nombreux festivals : le Festival de musique de Lucerne a lieu au palais de la culture et des congrès de Lucerne, le Festival international de musique de Sion (jusqu'en 2001, c'était le Festival international de musique Tibor Varga[217]), les festivals de musique en plein air[218] comme le Paléo Festival Nyon à Nyon, l'un des plus grands festivals de musique en plein air d'Europe, le Rock Oz'Arènes un festival ayant lieu dans le cadre de l'amphithéâtre romain d'Avenches.\n",
      " Montreux abrite plusieurs festivals renommés : le Festival de la Rose d'or[219] (dès 2004 à Lucerne au Palais de la culture et des congrès de Lucerne[220]), le Septembre musical, le Montreux Jazz Festival (1967)[221] et le Festival du rire de Montreux[222]. Pour le cinéma, le Festival international du film de Locarno à Locarno (1946) est un festival de film d'auteurs indépendants disposant d'une réputation internationale. Le festival de bande dessinée BDSierre (1984 – 2004) a attiré jusqu'à 40 000 personnes, il était réputé au-delà de la Suisse. Il a disparu pour des raisons financières[223].\n",
      " La culture alternative est née au début des années 1980. Les revendications de la jeunesse pour des centres culturels autonomes, les manifestations de cette époque contre les valeurs établies ont changé les mentalités. La culture alternative est désormais reconnue plus ou moins officiellement et les centres autonomes sont, au XXIe siècle, des lieux incontournables de la création artistique[224]. Quelques centres culturels pour la jeunesse ou centres de culture alternative : la Rote Fabrik de Zurich (depuis 1980)[225], la Kultur Kaserne de Bâle (depuis 1980)[226], la Reithalle Berne (partiellement en 1981 – 1982 puis durablement dès 1987)[227],[228], Artamis à Genève (1996-2008)[229].\n",
      " La ville de Zurich connaît un autre festival de plein air : la Street Parade. Ce festival a lieu dans les rues du centre de la ville chaque deuxième samedi du mois d'août. Comparable à la Love Parade de Berlin, au son de la musique « techno », chaque année cette manifestation attire plus de 700 000 personnes venues de tous les coins du pays[230].\n",
      " Plusieurs dizaines d'organisations et fédérations internationales sportives ont leur siège en Suisse : le Comité international olympique (CIO), le Tribunal arbitral du sport (TAS), la Fédération internationale de hockey sur glace (IIHF), la Fédération internationale de football association (FIFA), la Fédération internationale de gymnastique (FIG), l'Union des associations européennes de football (UEFA), l'Association européenne des clubs (ECA), l'Association européenne d'athlétisme (EAA), la Fédération internationale d'escrime, etc.\n",
      " Le hockey sur glace, le tennis, les sports hivernaux et le football sont très populaires. La gymnastique, le football, le tennis et le tir sportif sont les sports avec le plus grand nombre de licenciés par fédération[231]. En Formule 1, l'écurie Sauber est basée à Hinwil.\n",
      " En tennis, la Suisse remporte la Coupe Davis en 2014, avec une équipe composée de Roger Federer, Stanislas Wawrinka, Marco Chiudinelli et Michael Lammer. En 1992, l'équipe dans laquelle figurait Marc Rosset (champion olympique en simple la même année), Jakob Hlasek, Thierry Grin et Claudio Mezzadri a été défaite en finale par les États-Unis. En 1998, l'équipe composée de Martina Hingis, Patty Schnyder et Emmanuelle Gagliardi subit le même sort face à l'Espagne.\n",
      " Le Bâlois Roger Federer est considéré par de nombreux observateurs comme étant l'un des meilleurs joueurs de l'histoire de ce sport, sinon le meilleur : il détient le record de 305 semaines passées à la première place du classement mondial de tennis ATP World Tour, ainsi que le record masculin de 20 victoires dans les tournois du Grand Chelem. Il a terminé l'année calendaire à la première place mondiale à cinq reprises (en 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 et 2009). Il est médaillé d'or en double messieurs avec Stanislas Wawrinka aux Jeux olympiques de Pékin 2008 puis vice-champion olympique en simple à Londres en 2012. Roger Federer a gagné à ce jour 102 titres, dont 26 tournois majeurs (Grand Chelem et Masters) et 28 Masters 1000. Son doublé Roland-Garros—Wimbledon en 2009 lui a permis de réaliser le Grand Chelem en carrière sur cinq surfaces différentes. Il est le tennisman qui a atteint le plus de finales dans un même tournoi du Grand Chelem (11 finales à Wimbledon) et est le recordman de victoires à Wimbledon, avec huit succès entre 2003 et 2017. Parmi ses nombreux records, on peut également souligner ses dix finales, vingt-trois demi-finales et trente-six quarts de finale consécutifs dans les tournois du Grand Chelem.\n",
      " Chez les femmes, la Suisse compte en Martina Hingis la plus jeune numéro un de l'histoire en simple. La Saint-Galloise est restée au total 209 semaines au sommet de la hiérarchie féminine, se situant derrière des championnes comme Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, Serena Williams et Chris Evert. Elle a gagné au moins une fois tous les tournois du Grand Chelem en simple, en double et en double mixte, à l'exception du simple de Roland-Garros où elle a été battue deux fois en finale, ainsi qu'une médaille d'argent olympique en double avec Timea Bacsinszky.\n",
      " Le troisième émetteur public de radiodiffusion en Europe est mis en exploitation à Lausanne en 1922. Au cours des années suivantes, le pays voit la création de nombreuses sociétés de radiodiffusion. En 1923, la Suisse compte 980 concessionnaires radio[232].\n",
      " En 1930, les autorités fédérales réglementent la radiodiffusion, en regroupant l'ensemble des organisations régionales pour en faire une organisation de type fédéraliste, sous le nom de Société suisse de radiodiffusion (SSR), et qui se nomme aujourd'hui SRG SSR[232]. Durant cette période furent également mis en service les premiers émetteurs nationaux : à Sottens en mars 1931, Beromünster en mai de la même année et Monte Ceneri en octobre 1933. En 1953, la SSR inaugure un premier service expérimental de télévision[232].\n",

Cholesterol: Your LDL level may drop by 5% or so if you keep foods high in saturated fat off the menu. Additional soluble fiber may reduce LDL levels as well. So can margarines fortified with sterols. Cognitive decline: Memory training and other “brain exercises” seem to help healthy older people stay sharp. But physical exercise may benefit the brain more than mental gymnastics. Depression: Studies have shown that regular physical activity can have a potent antidepressant effect. Diabetes: Regular physical activity is a powerful brake on blood sugar levels as well, because exercised muscle becomes more receptive to the insulin that helps it pull sugar in from the bloodstream. Eating fewer sweets and easy-to-digest carbohydrates also helps control blood sugar levels. High blood pressure: Losing weight, getting more exercise, and eating less sodium all lower blood pressure. Osteoporosis: Weight-bearing exercise puts stress on bones, and bone tissue reacts by getting stronger and denser, fending off osteoporotic processes. Extra vitamin D and calcium top the list of dietary recommendations. We’ve gotten used to taking pills for everything that ails us, but medications have side effects and cost money.

      " The European drug agency recently released new statistics regarding drug deaths. They revealed that nearly a third of all European drug overdoses arise in the UK, with 3,744 falling victim to death by drug poisoning, from both legal and illegal drugs. While a majority of these deaths derived from an intake of NPO drugs – meaning drugs not taken by mouth – it is important to look where these drug addictions derive from. The use of ‘every day’ drugs like antidepressants, sleeping pills and pain killers, which can filter easily into peoples’ everyday lives should not be underestimated. These may not cause a drug overdose themselves (unless taken in vast quantities), but they can lead to a dependency, and in some instances lead patients to look for stronger drug options, which can have serious health implications, and addiction issues, in the long term. However, this does not mean that painkillers, anxiety medication or antidepressants can (or should) be avoided when so many people across the UK benefit enormously from their sensible and monitored usage. So with this in mind we must look at ways to control their use and avoid dependencies forming in the first place. Essential oils Stress often manifests itself physically in the body, causing aches, pains and other (often) far more serious physiological issues. To remedy simple aches and pains most of us would turn to paracetamol or ibuprofen but alternative methods might also provide similar quick relief. Essential oils are ideal to reduce any pain caused by stress. For example, massaging peppermint onto your forehead and temples is said to eliminate some headaches. Other oils that are useful include lavender oil, which is often used to relax your mind and can help anyone who has difficulties falling asleep. And Chamomile oil is often used to counteract chest pains or sore joints as it relaxes the muscles, and is perfect to add to a hot bath to unwind from daily stresses. Change in diet Did you know that certain foods and drinks (excluding alcohol which we all know about), can have a big impact our mental health? Coffee, energy drinks and some soft drinks contain a large amount of caffeine which can increase anxiety levels. Similarly, sugary and processed food won’t provide the same nourishment healthy fruits and vegetables will, and can impact mood and wellbeing as a result. A poor diet will not only affect your mental wellbeing, but can also influence your sleeping pattern and cause sleep deprivation, due to blood sugar fluctuations. The combination of all of these factors can often leave us feeling pretty down in the dumps, with some people turning to medication to counteract their blue mood. However, it’s imperative that before you turn to medicine, those with concerns first address their lifestyle and diet habits Tactics like introducing a ‘clean’ largely plant based diet, rich in magnesium and vitamin B is highly advised. Ingredients including spinach, nuts, salmon, avocado and bananas are perfect options. Healing foods Tomatoes, blueberries and nuts are all known for their anti-inflammatory properties and can be used as a natural supplement to drugs including ibuprofen, and sometimes even replace it if the pain is low level and you are attempting to manage symptoms in a holistic way. Additionally, sunflower seeds are ideal to absorb the pain of migraines and manage muscle pains. And by adding little bit of ginger and lemon to your tea it can help unblock a nose and reduce any cold and fever symptoms. Become active We’re advised that to maintain physical health we should be walking 10,000 steps a day, however, not many of us are actually reaching this goal, with most of us falling far below it. Of course exercise has endless physical benefits but it also keeps us mentally in check, allowing us to better manage stress levels and clear out those mental cobwebs. Similarly, it also helps reduce day time tiredness which can result from a lack of movement as our bodies remain under stimulated. So get those 10,000 steps in and go for a walk in the fresh air- it will make you feel more awake when you need to, and lead to better sleep at night. Martin Ricketts is CEO of Plutus Health\n",

      "By Nyemade  Boiwu   I have asthma. I use an inhaler because sometimes my lungs need the extra chemicals to help them function properly. No one thinks it’s “weird” or “weak” to use my inhaler. No one suggests that I should struggle through my inability to breathe rather than taking medication that will help. No one has a problem accepting that my lungs need the assistance of medication to work the same way other people’s do naturally. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about my depression and anxiety medication.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I think we're getting better at talking about mental health. Even mentioning a therapist isn't as taboo as it used to be. But there's still so much stigma around using medication to treat mental illness. Unfortunately, it was stigma that delayed me taking the medication I needed to feel okay.   I spent years doing everything I could to avoid needing to be on meds. I even moved to Florida on my own when I was 19 because of my depression with a seasonal pattern. My symptoms were so intense I was crying myself to sleep every night for months. It helped for a while, but I realized you can’t outrun depression, even with palm trees and sunshine.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I can't tell you how much better my life has been on medication. I’m all for trying other therapeutic methods before medication. However, just like any other health-related concern, sometimes medication is necessary to resolve the problem. Some people with depression may find success by working with a therapist to develop coping mechanisms. Others, including me, may find that therapy without medication is not enough. Especially when my symptoms are triggered by nothing at all.     Nyemade is a writer, speaker and digital content strategist.

      "                This is required Asking questions about your treatment or medicine is important to help you understand your options. You have a right to ask your pharmacist or doctor about the medicines you are prescribed, so don't feel shy. It also helps you to know what to expect if you take a medicine, stop taking it or don't take it at all. Here are 8 key questions to ask your doctor or pharmacist before taking a medicine. ASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment? Use the Pain Question Planner to prepare for your doctor’s appointment. Medicines work in different ways. Some medicines may reduce some or all of the symptoms of an illness; others may prevent illness or complications. Ask your doctor what benefits you can expect from the medicine, and then think about what those benefits mean to you. Side effects are unwanted effects of a medicine. All medicines can cause side effects, but not everybody will experience them. It's important to be aware of the side effects of medicines so that you know what to do if you experience them. Ask your doctor about: You can also get information about side effects from the consumer medicine information (CMI) leaflet that comes with all prescription and pharmacist-only medicines. Your pharmacist can show you where this is. You might decide you don't want to take a medicine your doctor has prescribed. This may be because: This is your right. Some conditions will get better whether you take a medicine or not. Other conditions will get worse and perhaps cause permanent damage to your health if you don't take a prescribed medicine. Asking your doctor or pharmacist what will happen if you don't take the medicine can help you make an informed choice. Some medicines, including pain-relief medicines, work almost immediately. Others, such as antidepressants, may take weeks before you notice a difference. Before you start taking a medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist how long it will take for the medicine to start working and how you will know if it is working. Check with your doctor first if you are thinking of stopping your medicine earlier than the prescribed time. There may be other medicines to consider for your condition. Some medicines may be more effective but have a greater risk of side effects. It is important to think about the benefits and risks for each treatment option. The cost of the medicines or treatments may also vary widely. Understanding the costs can help you make an informed choice. In some cases, medicine may not be the only or best approach to improving your condition. Sometimes lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, losing weight (if you are living with overweight or obesity) and physical activity, may be effective treatments. For some conditions, there might be other options such as physiotherapy, counselling or surgery. FIND A HEALTH SERVICE — The Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services. Medicines come in many forms, including: Some are taken once a day or once a week. Others are taken several times a day. Whatever the type of medicine, it is important to ask your doctor how and when to take it. You can also talk to a pharmacist or check the CMI. Some medicines are taken for only a short period. Others are taken for life. For example, antibiotics are usually taken for a limited time, but they need to be taken for the whole period prescribed — even if you start to feel better — to avoid antibiotic resistance. Always check with a healthcare professional if you plan to stop taking a medicine. Suddenly stopping some medicines, such as antidepressants, might cause unwanted symptoms. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises the cost of medicines for most medical conditions. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if the medicine is on the PBS. If it is not on the PBS, you will need to pay the full price. If the cost of the medicine is a problem, ask your doctor if there are more affordable options. Alcohol can interact with many medicines. This can change how both the alcohol and medicine affect you. This can happen even if you only drink a small amount of alcohol each day. If you drink alcohol while you take medicines, there may be short-term and/or long-term effects. Some short-term effects include increasing the effects of alcohol (feeling more drunk) and/or increasing the effects of the medicine (including side effects). These may affect your ability to drive, work safely or care for children. Long-term complications of mixing medicines and alcohol may include liver damage, heart problems, problems breathing or depression. If you plan to drink, ask your doctor or pharmacist about possible interactions between alcohol and the medicines you take. If you use other substances, ask about these as well.

      "             The pursuit of wealth should be motivated by a desire for financial security, not a longing for status or a luxurious lifestyle. If you start young and develop the right financial habits, a seven-digit net worth is an attainable goal. In his work with wealthy clients, Jason Flurry, CFP, founder and president of Legacy Partners Financial Group in Woodstock, Georgia, has found that those he calls “true millionaires,” people who gain wealth and keep it, see the role of money in their lives very differently than those who focus on what money can buy. “Having money for the sake of having money or ‘being rich’ never leaves a person feeling fulfilled,” he says. “Ironically, it can actually lead to a different set of problems most people haven’t thought about much in their pursuit of more.” With help from financial experts, we have come up with seven tips on how to become a millionaire. The advice is really simple, but reaching the goal is challenging. Saying you want to be wealthy won’t get you there. You must come up with a workable plan on how to become rich, put it on paper and then execute it. “The written plan forces you to do something; calculate what you need to earn and how to invest,” says Stewart Welch, founder of The Welch Group, a wealth management firm in Birmingham, Alabama. “The plan isn’t just the goal: it’s the whole thing,” says Welch. “The dream, the goals, the options.” The options require “scenario planning” — coming up with all the ways you can accomplish that goal, such as opening a Roth IRA or contributing to a 401(k), says Welch. Bankrate’s investment calculator can show you how much you’ll need to contribute and earn over time to reach your goal. “Saving money really means putting your own personal finances first,” says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. “So, think of saving money as a way of paying yourself first. By making saving money a priority, you are boosting the chances that your financial future is going to be stronger than your financial present or past.” Start by building an emergency fund in a savings account so you don’t have to raid the rest of your savings and investments when a big expense arises unexpectedly. Make a point of saving at least half of every pay raise. Explore high-yield savings account options to make sure you get the best returns on the money. Additionally, take advantage of your retirement fund. Max out your 401(k) and put any additional funds into a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Diversifying your savings is critical to getting the most out of what you put in. If you have a long time horizon before you plan to retire, seek out growth investments like stocks to increase your nest egg over time. “Don’t be among the many Americans whose top financial regret is the failure to save, either for emergencies or for retirement,” Hamrick says. Buying a big house or driving a very expensive car is too big a price to pay if it will reduce the amount of money you can save and invest. “This is really one of my favorite financial mantras,” Hamrick says. “Too many individuals, or consumers, are conditioned to think — or allow themselves to think — that their self-worth is somehow tied to their personal possessions.” Hamrick offers an alternative way to think. “But wouldn’t we really like for others to admire our resourcefulness and wealth-building, rather than our spending?” he says. “Financial success will be dictated, to a large degree, by how we manage our money, not by overspending.” People who are serious about becoming a millionaire for financial security are less likely to blow money on expensive cars and lavish vacations. And they’re not going to buy a house that stretches their budget too thin. Use Bankrate’s house calculator to determine how much house you can really afford. Paying yourself is better than paying a bank or a credit card company. Debt is your enemy. “When you are in debt, it is very hard to make progress toward securing your financial future because you have to pay your taxes and your debts before you can use any of your money for yourself,” Legacy Partners’ Flurry says. Flurry says you should avoid what he calls “dumb debt,” such as credit cards, car loans and most student loans. If you have a stack of credit card bills, pay them off and keep just one or two. Try not to put anything on your cards that you can’t pay off in two or three months. “Debt holds people back,” Flurry says. “They buy liabilities, and they make those payments forever.” You don’t need a lot of money to start investing. Open an account with a mutual fund company that has no-load funds and low expense ratios. You can also invest your money in the stock market by using an online broker like TD Ameritrade or E-Trade, which charge zero commissions for online stock trades. If you have the cash to buy property, consider investing in real estate. You can create an additional income stream by leasing a rental property and benefit from the appreciation in property value. It’s best not to invest all your money in one thing. Diversification, or owning many different types of investments, is less risky and will smooth out the ride. “Stick with the basics (a mix of stocks, bonds, cash and real estate) and not what your friends are doing. Everyone’s situation is different,” says Dana Twight, CFP, founder of Twight Financial Education in Seattle. “Your employer retirement plan is often a good place to begin,” says Twight. “It has automatic contributions, allowing you to invest without being concerned about today’s news.” If you want to increase your investments or diversify further, look into passive income opportunities, such as rental property or peer-to-peer lending. “Investing in different asset classes helps you weather all the storms, floods and calm moments in between,” Twight says. Build a diversified stock portfolio, and you can reasonably expect to earn 10 percent annually on your equity investments over the long haul. In their book “The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America’s Wealthy,” authors Thomas Stanley and William Danko say that two-thirds of millionaires are self-employed, and that entrepreneurs represent the majority of that group. The authors note that most millionaires have worked a long time, lived on less than they made, saved money and made smart investments. Entrepreneurs create most of the country’s wealth. In 1984, less than half of the people on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans were self-made millionaires, but by 2018, Americans who had built their own fortunes made up 67 percent of the list. A good financial advisor can steer you to the right investments and strategies and help you build and preserve wealth. But don’t sit back and let your advisor do all the thinking. Take an active interest in where your money is being invested and why. “We are all lifelong learners when it comes to personal finance,” Twight says. “Be willing to update your knowledge periodically and relate it to what is going on in the world, but keep your eyes on the prize.” If you can’t afford to have a financial planner manage your money, find one who will review your portfolio and make recommendations for a one-time fee. Bankrate’s “Save a million dollars calculator” can show you how long it will take for you to reach your goal. If you’re going to start working toward a seven-figure net worth, you must take a long view. Think about the importance of securing your financial future. “Naturally, having enough money to enjoy nice things and creating memorable experiences for yourself and those you care about the most are wonderful options to have, but having lasting financial security is far more valuable,” Flurry says. “When you don’t have to worry about money to meet your needs or provide for your lifestyle, you are free to think bigger and focus on the things in life that matter most.” \n",

      "\t\t\t\t Edited By Edited By There’s no magic formula for building wealth and getting rich. It’s simple, really: Spend less than you earn, and save as much money as you possibly can. But in a world filled with student loan debt, cost-of-living increases, growing inflation and sudden financial emergencies, executing this straightforward plan might sound like a fairytale. If your goal is to get rich, check out the following eight tips on how you can sidestep the obstacles and maintain your focus. They should help you understand what it takes to build wealth and find your way to financial security whether it is through investing or building your own business website. Featured Partner 1 Hostinger India Average Uptime 99.9% Price starts from INR 69/month Money Back Guarantee 30-day At 75% off + 3 months free on Hostinger's website 2 Bluehost Average Uptime 99.9% Price starts from INR 149/month Money Back Guarantee 30 day On Bluehost's website 3 Namecheap Average Uptime 99.97% Price starts from INR 117/month Money Back Guarantee 30 days On Namecheap's website To get rich, you need to start by defining exactly what rich means to you. Are you dreaming about Jeff Bezos being rich, or something more like INR 10,000 lakh in your retirement account? No two people define rich the same way, so you should set your own financial goals and outline a plan for how to get rich on your own terms. To help shape your goals, here are some questions to ask yourself: Answering questions like these can help you establish financial goals and decide how much money you need to save in order to fulfill your definition of rich. Then make a budget that lets you get to work. Not all debt is bad, but high-interest debt is downright terrible if your goal is to get rich. Part of your budget must involve a plan to crush your bad debt and maintain responsible levels of good debt, like a mortgage. The debt avalanche method is one of the most popular ways to rapidly reduce interest costs and pay down high-interest debt quickly. With this strategy, you’ll put the maximum toward your highest interest rate debt and make the minimum payments on other debts. Once the debt with the highest rates is paid in full, you’ll roll what you were paying over to address the next highest interest rate debt and pay it off. While you might be tempted to accelerate paying off lower interest rate debt like student loans or your mortgage, think again. You’ll save more in the long run by paying off your higher interest-rate debt first, and only then crushing that house payment and any lingering student loans. An emergency fund is critical to your strategy for getting rich. This isn’t your Bitcoin (BTC) stash or shares of Microsoft stock, either. Instead, it’s highly liquid cash, readily accessible in a low-risk savings vehicle, funded at levels that protect you from needing to take on high-interest credit card debt in an emergency. Many experts recommend having enough money to cover three to six months of expenses in your fund, but the amount you need to feel safe could be greater or less than that. Either way, build your emergency fund, keep it in a savings account that earns a high APY and remember to top it off after you use it. The longer you wait to start investing, the longer it will take to get rich. It’s not enough to save money. To get rich you must put your rupees to work by investing in markets. Learning how to invest is not a simple task, but the time to get started is now. Don’t be intimidated by the process: Start small, utilize the educational resources that are available on the platforms above and remember that the most important thing is to sustain regular contributions to your investment accounts.

That also happens to be one of the key concepts of investing: diversification. Once you begin your investing journey, you need to always keep in mind that building a diversified portfolio is essential to getting rich. It protects your wealth from the big wipe-outs that can happen when you only own a single type of asset, whether that’s crypto, yesterday’s hot stock, or the new wonder investment your neighbor told you about. Building a diversified portfolio means understanding asset allocation—putting your money into a mix of different asset classes aligned with your goals. When you’re younger and have more time to build wealth, you can take on riskier investments because you have plenty of time to recover from inevitable market declines. The older you get—and the closer you are to your definition of rich—you should shift to less risky assets to preserve the wealth you’ve built. Check out our basic asset allocation models to understand this core concept on a simple level. The most effective way to get rich is to learn about investing yourself, but you might also consider hiring a financial advisor to help you maintain your investment portfolio.

Boosting your earnings potential today helps you build a virtuous cycle of earning more, investing more and getting closer to your goals. Perhaps the easiest way to boost your income is by seeking advancement in your current position—although if that’s not in the cards, don’t be shy about considering a career change. Some ways to up your earnings include: Beyond your primary career path, you can also increase earnings with a side hustle or by starting a small business. A side hustle doesn’t have to last forever, but it provides a great income supplement to help you pay down debt or increase your investing budget. The FIRE movement—it stands for financial independence, retire early—could be something worth learning about if you want to get rich sooner rather than later. Adherents of the FIRE approach to investing attempt to cut all expenses as low as possible to maximize the amount of money available to invest. Instead of spending money on car loans and insurance, for instance, a FIRE practitioner would forgo owning an automobile and riding a bicycle everywhere, no matter what the weather. This is an extreme example, and we wouldn’t really want you to give up owning a car. But some of the movement’s rules of thumb could be useful, like the rule of 25, which tells you how much money you need to achieve financial independence, aka getting rich. The rule calls on you to save 25 times your annual expenses before retiring early. For example, if you spend INR 35,000 per year, you’d need to save INR 8,75,000. FIRE strategies can help you get rich quicker than you might without an aggressive savings plan. If you’re ready to supercharge your wealth-building goals, this list of FIRE blogs can help you learn about the movement. There’s a reason the phrase “get rich quick” is usually followed by the word “scheme.” That’s because there are vanishingly few ways to get rich quickly, and anyone telling you that’s not the case is probably trying to defraud you in a scheme. As we’ve outlined above, getting rich means knowing what you want and having the discipline to do what it takes. This all takes time, but it is doable—and it’s worth it. Make a plan and stick to it, and you’ll see progress when you take the right steps to build wealth. If someone whispers that they have a “sure thing” and you “can’t lose,” get away from them as quickly as possible. Just know that nothing’s certain, few things happen as quickly as you’d like, and getting rich is your reward for a plan well-executed—with patience. \n",

      "Many college courses require you to memorize mass amounts of information. Memorizing for one class can be difficult, but it can be even more frustrating when you have multiple classes. Many students feel like they simply do not have strong memory skills. Fortunately, though, memorizing is not just for an elite group of people born with the right skills—anyone can train and develop their memorizing abilities.  Competitive memorizers claim that practicing visualization techniques and using memory tricks enable them to remember large chunks of information quickly. Research shows that students who use memory tricks perform better than those who do not. Memory tricks help you expand your working memory and access long term memory. These techniques can also enable you to remember some concepts for years or even for life. Finally, memory tricks like these lead to understanding and higher order thinking. Keep reading for an introduction to effective memorization techniques that will help you in school. In addition to visual and spatial memory techniques, there are many others tricks you can use to help your brain remember information. Here are some simple tips to try. Check out this video from the Learning Center for a quick explanation of many of these tips.  Try to understand the information first. Information that is organized and makes sense to you is easier to memorize. If you find that you don’t understand the material, spend some time on understanding it before trying to memorize it. Link it. Connect the information you are trying to memorize to something that you already know. Material in isolation is more difficult to remember than material that is connected to other concepts. If you cannot think of a way to connect the information to something you already know, make up a crazy connection. For example, say you are trying to memorize the fact that water at sea level boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, and 212 happens to be the first three digits of your best friend’s phone number. Link these two by imagining throwing your phone into a boiling ocean. It’s a crazy link, but it can help that fact to stick.     Sleep on it. Studies show that your brain processes and stores information while you sleep. Try to review information just before you go to sleep—even if it’s only for a few minutes—and see if it helps embed the information in your memory.  Self-test. Quiz yourself every so often by actively recalling the information you are trying to study. Make sure to actively quiz yourself—do not simply reread notes or a textbook. Often, students think they remember material just because it is familiar to them when they reread it. Instead, ask yourself questions and force yourself to remember it without looking at the answer or material. This will enable you to identify areas that you are struggling with; you can then go back to one of the memory tricks to help yourself memorize it. Also, avoid quizzing yourself immediately after trying to memorize something. Wait a few hours, or even a day or two, to see if it has really stuck in your memory.     Use distributed practice. For a concept to move from your temporary working memory to your long-term memory, two things need to happen: the concept should be memorable and it should be repeated. Use repetition to firmly lodge information in your memory. Repetition techniques can involve things like flash cards, using the simple tips in this section, and self-testing. Space out your studying and repetition over several days, and start to increase the time in between each study session. Spacing it out and gradually extending the times in between can help us become more certain of mastery and lock the concepts into place.    Write it out. Writing appears to help us more deeply encode information that we’re trying to learn because there is a direct connection between our hand and our brain.  Try writing your notes by hand during a lecture or rewriting and reorganizing notes or information by hand after a lecture. While you are writing out a concept you want to remember, try to say the information out loud and visualize the concept as well.  Create meaningful groups. A good strategy for memorizing is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material. For example, let’s say you wanted to remember the names of four plants—garlic, rose, hawthorn, and mustard. The first letters abbreviate to GRHM, so you can connect that with the image of a GRAHAM cracker. Now all you need to do is remember to picture a  graham cracker, and the names of the plants will be easier to recall.   Use mnemonics. Mnemonics are systems and tricks that make information for memorable. One common type is when the first letter of each word in a sentence is also the first letter of each word in a list that needs to be memorized. For example, many children learned the order of operations in math by using the sentence Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (parentheses, exponents, multiply, divide, add, subtract).  Check out Wikipedia for a good list of examples and ideas.  Talk to yourself. It may seem strange at first, but talking to yourself about the material you are trying to memorize can be an effective memory tool. Try speaking aloud instead of simply highlighting or rereading information.  Exercise! Seriously! Studies show that exercise can improve our memory and learning capabilities because it helps create neurons in areas that relate to memory. Cardio and resistance training (weights) both have powerful effects, so do what works best for you. Practice interleaving. Interleaving is the idea of mixing or alternating skills or concepts that you want to memorize. For example, spend some time memorizing vocabulary words for your science class and then immediately switch to studying historical dates and names for your history class. Follow that up with practicing a few math problems, and then jump back to the science definitions. This method may seem confusing at first, but yields better results in the end than simply spending long periods of time on the same concept. Check out this video for more explanation on interleaving and other similar strategies. Visual and spatial techniques are memory tricks that involve your five senses. They utilize images, songs, feelings, and our bodies to help information stick. Humans have outstanding visual and spatial memory systems. When you use visual and spatial memory techniques, you use fun, memorable, and creative approaches rather than boring, rote memorization. This makes it easier to see, feel, or hear the things you want to remember. Visual and spatial techniques also free up your working memory. When you group things together, you enhance your long-term memory. Using visual and spatial techniques helps your mind focus and pay attention when your mind would rather wander to something else. They help you make what you learn meaningful, memorable, and fun.  The common practice of using your knuckles to remember the number of days in each month is a great example of an easy visual spatial technique to help you remember details. Memorable visual images. The next time you have a key item you need to remember, try making a memorable visual image to represent that item. Images are important because they connect directly to your brain’s visuospatial centers. Images help you remember difficult concepts by tapping into visual areas. But you don’t just have to use images—the more of the five senses you can use, the easier it will be for you to recall information.  Rather than just visualizing an image, try to smell, feel, and hear the image as well. For example, if you are trying to remember that the capital of Louisiana is Baton Rouge, draw up an image of a girl named Louise carrying a red baton. The memory palace technique. This technique involves visualizing a familiar place—like the layout of your house or dorm room—and using it as a visual space where you can deposit concept-images that you want to remember. This technique can help with remembering unrelated items, like a grocery list. To use the memory palace technique, visualize your place (house or dorm room) and then imagine items from your grocery list in different areas around the place. For example, picture a cracked egg dripping off the edge of the table or a bushel of apples sitting on the couch. This technique can take some time to get used to, but once you do, the quicker and more effective it becomes.  This Ted Talk explains memory palaces more. Songs and jingles. Much like the memory palace and images, songs or jingles use your brain’s right hemisphere and can help us remember tricky things like equations and lists.  There are already plenty of songs out there for things like the quadratic formula—try Googling what you are trying to remember to see if someone has already created a tune.  If not, try making your own.  The five senses. Using as many of the five senses as possible when studying helps you use more parts of your brain and retain information better. For example, if studying for an anatomy exam, pick up the anatomy models, feel each part, and say the names of them out loud. Lively visual metaphors or analogies. This can help you to not only remember but understand concepts, especially in math and science. A metaphor is a way of realizing that one thing is somehow similar to another. For example, think about the country of Syria as shaped like a bowl of cereal and the country Jordan as a Nike Air Jordan sneaker. Metaphors—especially visual ones—can stick with you for years. They help glue ideas in your mind because they make connections to neural structures that are already there. Some of these techniques can feel strange at first or take some time to develop.  The more you practice them, the easier and more natural they become, and the more information you can commit to memory. Also, remember that you do not need to do every tip on this list.  Experiment with a few and find which ones work for you.  Remember that you can make an appointment with an academic coach to discuss memory techniques, create a study plan, or talk through any other academic issue.

      "How Zapier’s RevOps team automates lead management Using AI & Zapier in Marketing, Sales, & RevOps Create your first Zap with ease Home Productivity Productivity tips Productivity tips Despite taking piano lessons and music composition classes for nearly a decade, I remember very little about how to actually play the piano or how to transpose a song. What I do remember—with very little effort—are the notes on the lines and spaces of a treble clef staff. How? With the help of a mnemonic device (a fancy term for a technique used to boost your ability to retain and recall information).  That's the neat thing about memorization tools: they can help you remember things you haven't thought about for years—decades, even. And these techniques go beyond boosting just your long-term memory. They can also help improve your working and short-term memory.  No matter what you're trying to memorize—a video script, the periodic table of elements, your grocery list—here are 11 memorization techniques you can use to strengthen your memory for any period of time.  If you want to first geek out on how memory works, keep reading. To jump straight to the memorization techniques, click on any of the links below.  Acronyms and acrostics Music mnemonics Rhyming mnemonics Chunking Build a memory palace Write it down Use spaced repetition Make visual connections Share what you're learning Get more sleep Move your body In order to truly appreciate the magic—I mean, science—behind memorization techniques, it's important to understand the basics of how memory works. Since the intricacies of the human brain are well beyond the scope of this article and this writer's degree in French literature, let's break it down with a heavy assist from some very smart people.  As neuroscientist Daphna Shohamy explains, \"our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past.\" And according to How Memory Works, published by Harvard University, there are \"three main processes that characterize how memory works: encoding, storage, and retrieval.\" Encoding refers to how you learn and understand information. When you attach emotions and meaning to this information—referred to as semantic encoding—you're more likely to remember it and recall it later on.  Storage refers to how much information is saved in your brain, where, and for how long. There are two commonly highlighted memory stores: short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM).  Retrieval refers to how you access your memories.  Think of your short-term memory as your brain's scratchpad. It's where your brain temporarily stores information (about 15 to 30 seconds) before either dismissing it or transferring it to your long-term memory.  In terms of accessing your long-term memories, your brain has four ways of doing this: recall, collection, recognition, and relearning. How your brain retrieves information depends on the availability of external clues or prompts or the lack thereof.  Now that you understand the basics of how memory works, you can use that information to improve your memory.  Mnemonic devices are learning strategies used to boost your memory. Whether or not you realize it, you probably use mnemonics in your daily life to help you retain and recall information. I'll start with some of the most common mnemonic devices before moving on to other memorization tactics.  You may already be familiar with acronyms and acrostics as a mnemonic device. This method requires you to create a new word or group of words by taking the first letter of each word and putting them together.  For example, to remember the names of the planets in our solar system, you might use this acrostic mnemonic: my very educated mother just served us noodles. In this example, the first letter of each word corresponds with the first letter of each planet, respectively.  My partner knows all the words to House of Pain's Jump Around—yet he can't remember what I asked him to pick up from the grocery store an hour ago. Why? Because it's easier to remember a catchy song than it is to remember a long string of meaningless words or letters, such as a grocery list yelled to you while you're halfway out the door. The next time you need to remember something, try pairing that information with a tune you're already familiar with. And if you just so happen to need help memorizing the periodic table of elements, look no further than the periodic table song. Similar to music mnemonics, rhyming mnemonics take advantage of catchy beats and patterns created by ending each line with a rhyme to help you retain information. Here's a rhyming mnemonic I still use to this day to help avoid spelling errors: \"I before E except after C.\" Sadly, clever rhymes don't come naturally to me. If you're in the same boat, here's a little trick: let AI-powered tools like ChatGPT do the heavy lifting for you.  Have you ever repeated a phone number out loud by grouping numbers together? For example, \"six, four, seven, triple five, eleven, twenty-one\" (instead of \"6-4-7-5-5-5-1-1-2-1\"). This is chunking. It's another mnemonic device that involves grouping individual pieces of information—like long strings of numbers—into larger, more memorable groups.  And chunking isn't just limited to aiding the memorization of numbers. Another practical application of chunking would be grouping items on your grocery list by aisle. Or if you're learning a new language, grouping new vocabulary words together by category.  The memory palace technique, also known as the Method of Loci, is another popular mnemonic device. This technique involves mentally mapping out a physical space you're familiar with (a memory palace) and \"placing\" images representing the information you're memorizing in various spots or loci. (Loci is the plural form of locus, which means \"place\" or \"location.\") When you need to recall that information, simply visualize your memory palace and retrieve it.  Here's how to create and use your own memory palace:   Choose your memory palace. Select a space that you're incredibly familiar with (e.g., your childhood home or the route you take to work), and create a mental map of it. Identify distinct loci throughout your palace. Mentally walk through your palace, and pick different locations where you can \"place\" unique images (more on that in step 3). For example, the door to your coat closet, the lamp in your living room, and the dog bed in your guest room.  Assign images to specific locations. Let's say you're trying to remember this grocery list: milk, chocolate chip cookies, and bananas. Place images of each of those items at your chosen locations. Or, to make it more memorable, create vivid images representing each item and place those at different locations. The more animated and outrageous, the better. For example, you could picture a waterfall of milk pouring over your closet door, your living room lamp teetering on top of a mountain of chocolate chip cookies, and a dog juggling bananas while standing on its bed.  While this technique may sound absurd, it does work. Just take it from five-time USA Memory Champion Nelson Dellis, who uses the memory palace technique to help him quickly remember a full deck of cards, in sequence. Reciting information is a useful way to memorize something fast because it forces you to actively engage with the information (as opposed to passively taking everything in), which, in turn, increases your ability to remember and recall it later on. Here are some practical ways to add reciting to your memorization toolkit.  While typing your notes might be faster and more convenient, especially if you have to take in a lot of information, there are advantages to doing things the old-fashioned way (i.e., taking pen to paper).  In a 2014 study, researchers Pam A. Mueller and Daniel M. Oppenheimer examined the effects on learning and retention when students took notes by hand versus on a laptop. In terms of generative note-taking (e.g., \"summarizing, paraphrasing, concept mapping\"), students who took notes by hand had better retention and understanding of the material compared to those who took notes on a laptop.  Why? The researchers suggest two possible reasons. First, there are fewer possible distractions, such as checking emails or social media, when writing notes. Second, generative note-taking encourages students to reframe the information into their own words, which aids in encoding.  Spaced repetition is a memorization technique that involves reviewing the same information at increasing intervals until that information is embedded into your long-term memory. If you've ever tried to learn a new language using apps like Duolingo or Rosetta Stone, you've used spaced repetition.  Here's a simple way to apply this technique. Let's say you're learning another language and you need help remembering new vocabulary. Write the word in your native tongue on a flashcard. Or, to make it more fun, sketch an image of the word. Then review the flashcards daily. As you become more consistent recalling your new vocabulary words, you can increase the time between reviews from daily to weekly to monthly. If you need to create a lot of flashcards, you can also use apps, like Quizlet, to do the heavy lifting for you.  Tapping into the power of imagery and storytelling can significantly boost your memory because it encourages you to establish stronger connections with the information you're trying to remember. Here are some practical ways to do this.  The use of visual stimuli is a common method used to learn and recall information. Here are some strategies you can use to enhance your visual memory.  Turn the sound of names into images. If you have difficulty remembering people's names, try connecting their names with an image. For example, if a stranger introduces himself as Mike, you might picture him holding a microphone.  Animate the images. Similar to creating visuals for your memory palace, the more animated and vivid you can make your images, the better. Doing this creates stronger connections in your brain between the word and the image. Continuing with the name train, let's take the name Melanie. For this, you might visualize the person dressed in a gi, crushing a melon against their knee. (I bet you won't forget that visual anytime soon.) Let's say you're going to a dog training seminar. Your best friend has a dog, and they want you to share some of your key takeaways after. So you furiously scribble down notes, ask questions, and scribble some more. This goes to the heart of the Protégé Effect, which suggests that people put in more effort to learn information when they know they're going to teach it to someone else.  Then when you share your key takeaways, you're likely to explain the concepts you learned in your own words. You'll probably even demonstrate a few of these lessons while explaining the concepts, which will make it more meaningful. And these acts—paraphrasing and adding meaning to information—all help with encoding.  Turns out, taking care of your body also takes care of your brain. You've heard these tips before, but here's how your physical well-being can improve your memory. As a shock to no one, there's a direct relationship between sleep and productivity—and that productivity extends to our ability to take in new information.  As much as possible, try to get your recommended six to eight hours of deep sleep—the knocked-out-cold kind—every night. This will help \"reset\" your brain, allowing you to wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world—or, at least, more information.  Just as sleep is important for both your physical and mental health, so, too, is that other pillar of health: exercise. Moving your body regularly at moderate intensity—whatever that looks like to you—can directly and indirectly boost your memory. Indirectly, it can reduce anxiety and stress, and improve the quality of your sleep. Oftentimes, problems in these areas contribute to cognitive impairment. Directly, it improves the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your brain. This blood flow keeps your brain functioning properly, which includes processing and storing information.  Adult human brains can store the equivalent of 2.5 million gigabytes of memory. So, in theory, you have the capacity to memorize…everything. But just because you can, doesn't mean you have to.  Instead, use the memorization techniques listed in this article to help you recall the information that you might need at the drop of a hat, like your emergency contact's phone number. Or the password to your password manager. Everything else? Use a note-taking app to take a cognitive load off.  Related reading: 5 tools that improved my note-taking and changed how I learn What does \"thinking big\" really mean?

      "Our memories are an integral part of who we are, but as we age our memory declines. For many older adults, the decline becomes so serious that they’re no longer able to live independently, which is one of the biggest fears adults have as they age. The good news is that scientists have been learning more about our brain’s amazing capacity to change and grow new neural connections each day, even in old age. This concept is known as neuroplasticity. Through research on neuroplasticity, scientists have discovered that our memory capacity isn’t fixed, but rather malleable like plastic. To take full advantage of neuroplasticity, you’ll need to exercise your brain and take care of your body. These 25 tips and tricks are some of the most effective methods for improving memory. Memory strength is just like muscular strength. The more you use it, the stronger it gets. But you can’t lift the same size weight every day and expect to get stronger. You’ll need to keep your brain constantly challenged. Learning a new skill is an excellent way to strengthen your brain’s memory capacity. There are many activities to choose from, but most importantly, you’ll need to find something that forces you out of your comfort zone and commands your full attention. Here are some examples: Research from 2007 showed that speaking more than one language can delay the onset of memory problems in people with dementia. Any time you learn a new piece of information, you’re more likely to mentally record that information if it’s repeated. Repetition reinforces the connections we create between neurons. Repeat what you hear out loud. Try using it in a sentence. Write it down and read it aloud. But the work doesn’t stop there. Research shows that simple repetition is an ineffective learning tool if used on its own. You’ll need to sit back down later and actively try to retrieve the information without looking at where you wrote it down. Testing yourself to retrieve the information is better than repeated studying. Practicing retrieval creates more long-term and meaningful learning experiences. Mnemonic devices can be in the form of acronyms, abbreviations, songs, or rhymes. Mnemonics have been tested since the 1960s as an effective strategy for students. You’ve probably been taught a few mnemonic devices for remembering long lists. For example, the colors of the spectrum can be remembered with the name ROY G. BIV (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet). Grouping or chunking refers to the process of dividing newly learned information into chunks to produce fewer, larger chunks of information. For example, you may have noticed that it’s much easier to remember a phone number if the 10 digits are grouped into three separate chunks (e.g. 555-637-8299) rather than one long number (5556378299). The mind palace technique is often used by memory champions. In this ancient technique, you create a visual and complex place to store a set of memories. For more instructions on how to create memory palaces, watch 2006 U.S. Memory Champion Joshua Foer’s TED talk. Another tactic of memory connoisseurs is that they don’t just rely on one sense to help retain information. Instead, they relate information to other senses, like colors, tastes, and smells. Modern technology has its place, but unfortunately has made us “mentally lazy.” Before you reach for your phone to ask Siri or Google, make a solid attempt to retrieve the information with your mind. This process helps reinforce the neural pathways in your brain. Another common mistake is relying on the GPS every time you drive. Researchers found in 2013 that relying on response techniques — such as GPS — for navigation, shrinks a part of our brain called the hippocampus, which is responsible for spatial memory and moving information from short-term to long-term memory. Poor hippocampus health is associated with dementia and memory decline. Unless you’re totally lost, try to get to your destination using your brain instead of just following the instructions on your GPS. Perhaps use GPS to get there, but use your brain to get back home. Your brain will thank you for the extra challenge. A busy schedule can maintain your brain’s episodic memory. One study linked busy schedules to better cognitive function. This study, however, was limited by self-reporting. An organized person has an easier time remembering. Checklists are one good tool for organization. Manually writing down your checklist (instead of doing it electronically) also increases the likelihood that you’ll remember what you’ve written down. Go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time each morning. Try not to break your routine on the weekends. This can greatly improve sleep quality. The blue light emitted by cell phone, TV, and computer screens inhibits the production of melatonin, a hormone that controls your sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm). A poorly regulated sleep cycle can really take a toll on sleep quality. Without enough sleep and rest, the neurons in our brain become overworked. They can no longer coordinate information, making it more difficult to access memories. Roughly an hour before bedtime, turn off your devices and allow your brain to unwind. Diets such as the Mediterranean diet, DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension), and the MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay) have a few things in common. This includes their ability to improve memory and reduce the risk of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. These diets focus on eating: Fatty fish are a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s play an important role in building brain and nerve cells. They’re essential for learning and memory and have been shown to delay cognitive decline. Proponents of the Mediterranean and MIND diets say to avoid the following foods: Sugar and fat has been linked to impaired memory. A recent study in humans found that a diet high in fats and sugars — common in a Western diet — impairs hippocampal memory. However, the study relied on questionnaires and surveys, which may not be as accurate. While you should still take your medications prescribed by your doctor, remember to follow your doctor’s instructions for dietary and lifestyle changes too. Some prescriptions, like statins for high cholesterol, have been associated with memory loss and “brain fog.” Losing weight and eating healthier may also play a role in treating high cholesterol. Other medications that might affect memory include: Talk to your doctor about how to manage your medical conditions so you don’t have to rely on a prescription forever. If you’re worried about how a medication may affect your memory, talk to your doctor about your options. Exercising has been shown to have cognitive benefits. It improves oxygen and nutrient delivery to the body, and helps to create new cells in the brain which are essential for memory storage. Exercise especially increases the number of cells in the hippocampus. There’s no need for the exercise to be strenuous. Walking, for example, is a great choice. When you’re stressed, your body releases stress hormones like cortisol. Cortisol has been shown to greatly impair the brain’s memory process, especially our ability to retrieve long-term memories. Stress and depression have even been shown in animal studies to shrink the brain. Check out this article for 16 easy ways to reduce stress and anxiety. Humans are social creatures. Research shows that a strong support system is vital to our emotional and brain health. One study from 2007 found that people with very active social lives had the slowest memory decline. Just 10 minutes of talking to another person was shown to improve memory. Your brain is made mostly of water. Water acts as a shock absorber for the brain and spinal cord. It helps our brain cells use nutrients. So just a small amount of dehydration can have disastrous effects. Mild dehydration has been shown to cause brain shrinkage and memory impairment. Aim for at least eight to ten glasses per day, or more if you’re very active. Caffeine has actually been shown to enhance memory and reduce risk of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. But this one comes with a caveat. Having too much caffeine, or consuming it later in the day, can have the opposite effect as it can impair sleep in sensitive individuals. It’s true that moderate consumption of alcohol may have a positive effect on memory, but keep in mind that moderate means just one drink for women and two for men each day. Drinking more than that can have a negative effect on your ability to retain information as well as your sleep. There’s mounting evidence for the health benefits of meditation. Studies show that meditation helps improve several cognitive functions, like focus, concentration, memory, and learning. Meditation may actually rewire the brain and encourage more connections between brain cells. There are several ways to meditate — find out which one is right for you. Getting out into nature is incredibly important for our emotional and physical health. Enjoying nature can even be considered a form of meditation. One 2008 study found that a walk in a park improved memory and attention compared to walking in a city. Likewise, daily gardening lowers your risk of dementia by 36 percent, according to one 2006 study. One study from 2012 found that a mere 20 minutes of yoga significantly improved participants’ speed and accuracy on memory tests. Participants performed significantly better on the tests after yoga compared to aerobic exercise. The study, however, was limited by its narrow sample size of just 30 young, female students. Yoga also emphasizes breathing from the diaphragm, which helps maximize our oxygen intake, thus improving mental function. People with more fatty tissue tend to have less water than people with less fatty tissue. Overweight people also have less brain tissue. The more overweight you are, the more your brain is likely to shrink and affect your memory. Follow this guide for tips on losing weight naturally. Our memory is a skill, and just like other skills, it can be improved with practice and healthy overall habits. You can start small. For example, pick a new challenging activity to learn, incorporate a few minutes of exercise into your day, maintain a sleep schedule, and eat a few more green vegetables, fish, and nuts. The next time you have to study for an exam, try one of the techniques suggested by memory champions, like chunking, mind palaces, or retrieval. Talk to your doctor if you notice that you’re making many more mistakes than usual or have trouble completing simple daily tasks, like cooking or cleaning.

      " As we grow older, we all start to notice some changes in our ability to remember things. Maybe you've gone into the kitchen and can't remember why or can't recall a familiar name during a conversation. You may even miss an appointment because it slipped your mind. Memory lapses can occur at any age, but we tend to get more upset by them as we get older because we fear they're a sign of dementia, or loss of intellectual function. The fact is, significant memory loss in older people isn't a normal part of aging—but is due to organic disorders, brain injury, or neurological illness, with Alzheimer's being among the most feared. Most of the fleeting memory problems that we experience with age reflect normal changes in the structure and function of the brain. These changes can slow certain cognitive processes, making it a bit harder to learn new things quickly or screen out distractions that can interfere with memory and learning. Granted, these changes can be frustrating and may seem far from benign when we need to learn new skills or juggle myriad responsibilities. Thanks to decades of research, there are various strategies we can use to protect and sharpen our minds. Here are seven you might try. A higher level of education is associated with better mental functioning in old age. Experts think that advanced education may help keep memory strong by getting a person into the habit of being mentally active. Challenging your brain with mental exercise is believed to activate processes that help maintain individual brain cells and stimulate communication among them. Many people have jobs that keep them mentally active but pursuing a hobby or learning a new skill can function the same way. Read; join a book group; play chess or bridge; write your life story; do crossword or jigsaw puzzles; take a class; pursue music or art; design a new garden layout. At work, propose or volunteer for a project that involves a skill you don't usually use. Building and preserving brain connections is an ongoing process, so make lifelong learning a priority. The more senses you use in learning something, the more of your brain will be involved in retaining the memory. In one study, adults were shown a series of emotionally neutral images, each presented along with a smell. They were not asked to remember what they saw. Later, they were shown a set of images, this time without odors, and asked to indicate which they'd seen before. They had excellent recall for all odor-paired pictures, and especially for those associated with pleasant smells. Brain imaging indicated that the piriform cortex, the main odor-processing region of the brain, became active when people saw objects originally paired with odors, even though the smells were no longer present and the subjects hadn't tried to remember them. So, challenge all your senses as you venture into the unfamiliar. For example, try to guess the ingredients as you smell and taste a new restaurant dish. Give sculpting or ceramics a try, noticing the feel and smell of the materials you're using. Myths about aging can contribute to a failing memory. Middle-aged and older learners do worse on memory tasks when they're exposed to negative stereotypes about aging and memory, and better when the messages are positive about memory preservation into old age. People who believe that they are not in control of their memory function are less likely to work at maintaining or improving their memory skills and therefore are more likely to experience cognitive decline. If you believe you can improve and you translate that belief into practice, you have a better chance of keeping your mind sharp. If you don't need to use mental energy remembering where you laid your keys or the time of your granddaughter's birthday party, you'll be better able to concentrate on learning and remembering new and important things. Take advantage of calendars and planners, maps, shopping lists, file folders, and address books to keep routine information accessible. Designate a place at home for your glasses, purse, keys, and other items you use often. Remove clutter from your office or home to minimize distractions, so you can focus on new information that you want to remember. When you want to remember something you've just heard, read, or thought about, repeat it out loud or write it down. That way, you reinforce the memory or connection. For example, if you've just been told someone's name, use it when you speak with him or her: \"So, John, where did you meet Camille?\" If you place one of your belongings somewhere other than its usual spot, tell yourself out loud what you've done. And don't hesitate to ask for information to be repeated. Repetition is most potent as a learning tool when it's properly timed. It's best not to repeat something many times in a short period, as if you were cramming for an exam. Instead, re-study the essentials after increasingly longer periods of time — once an hour, then every few hours, then every day. Spacing out periods of study is particularly valuable when you are trying to master complicated information, such as the details of a new work assignment. Research shows that spaced rehearsal improves recall not only in healthy people but also in those with certain physically based cognitive problems, such as those associated with multiple sclerosis. This is a creative way to remember lists. Mnemonic devices can take the form of acronyms (such as RICE to remember first-aid advice for injured limbs: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation) or sentences (such as the classic \"Every good boy does fine\" to remember the musical notes E, G, B, D, and F on the lines of the treble clef). \n",

      "Home Programs Offices About us Careers Home Programs Offices About us Careers When you ask a language student what their goals are, almost everyone says “improve my speaking”. When learning a foreign language, you’ll find yourself talking with all kinds of native speakers – your teacher, servers in restaurants, taxi drivers and your landlord, so it’s vital that you feel comfortable. Just like improving your writing, listening or any other skill, there are techniques you can use to improve your spoken English in a targeted way. Here are eight of our favorites: Let’s start right off by saying that there isn’t a magic pill for better speaking. That would be too easy, right? Basically, the best way to speak better is to, well – speak! Commit to practicing often and with as many different people as possible. Do you already live or study overseas? Take advantage of the thousands of native speakers in your immediate community, such as your friends, their families, your coworkers, classmates, employees at the coffee shops, supermarket, post-office and other places you visit. If you’re learning in your own country, increase your practice time by meeting your classmates after class, finding an language exchange partner or joining an online community of learners. After your conversation is over, take a moment to reflect. How did it go? How much do you think you understood? How comfortable did you feel with that subject matter? Did you encounter any unknown words? The mere act of thinking about it in this way will increase your confidence for the next time you speak (and give your targeted things to work on, for example vocabulary you didn’t understand). You need words in order to talk, right? Class time is great for learning vocabulary, but there are other ways you can increase yours: Watch movies, listen to music, the radio and to podcasts. Read books, magazines and blogs. When listening and reading, find new and interesting expressions, slang terms and synonyms, write down this new material and look up anything you’re not familiar with. All this will provide more “meat” for you to use next time you practice. Part of nervousness around speaking is the feeling of not knowing what to say. To combat this, prepare a cheat sheet. Are you going to the doctor’s? Before your appointment, research vocabulary relating to your condition and some common phrases you’ll probably need. Use the technique before going to pay a bill, eating at a restaurant, job interviews, making a complaint, or for any other situation that might make you anxious. Most people find phone conversations particularly challenging. Why? Because on the phone, we can’t see the other person’s body language or watch their mouth move, both of which are tools that really help communication. To feel more confident on the phone, start small with phone conversations with friends – then move on to more challenging calls like making appointments or inquiries. (This is a great time to use tip 4, and prepare a list of questions and useful vocabulary to help you during your call!) We know, we know – most people dislike hearing their voice recorded – but it’s actually an extremely beneficial way to improve your speaking! Hearing yourself on tape shows you things you might not realize (maybe you tend to speak quickly when nervous, swallow your “s’s” or mumble). On the other hand, you could be pleasantly surprised to hear that your speaking is far better than you thought! For bonus points, take your recording to your teacher or to a native speaker friend and have them give you feedback. Another tip to increase your fluency is to speak using a variety of phrases rather than individual words. (You probably do this all the time in your native language.) Instead of automatically asking “Hello, how are you today?”, mix it up by choosing other expressions like “What’s up, man?” “Hey dude!” or “How ya going, mate?” (Be careful though: Some expressions will be very informal and not ideal for some situations!) Let’s face it. It’s far easier to learn something new when you’re having fun.

      "Do you want to learn new words and phrases in English? Here are five tips to improve your English vocabulary. Learning vocabulary is a big part of learning a language. The more English words you learn, the better you can communicate your needs, ideas, thoughts and feelings to other people in English.  Vocabulary is essential for understanding too. In fact, learning new words is one of the biggest things you can do to improve your reading and listening. So what can you do to build your English vocabulary quickly and effectively? Here are five tips for better vocabulary learning. It's a really good idea to write down useful new vocabulary. The act of writing the words helps you remember them better. Plus, lots of people learn better when they see things written on paper, rather than just hearing them.  You can add a translation in your language, a definition in English, a note on pronunciation or even a drawing! The more different links you make between the word and its meaning, the better. So, you've got an English notebook full of useful vocabulary to remember. But did you know that if you don't look again at the new words and phrases you've studied, you only remember on average 20–25 per cent of it? That's a shocking waste of time and effort!  The good news is that if you look at your notes again after an hour, again the next day and once more after a few days, you can make sure that 100 per cent of what you learn goes into your long-term memory.  So make five minutes each day to revise your English vocabulary. The more you look backwards, the faster you go forwards!  They say the best way to learn a language is by immersion – spending time completely surrounded by that language.  Well, reading is like immersion through your imagination!  Reading is amazing for your English in general. But it's particularly good for learning new vocabulary. That's because understanding a new word as part of a story makes it much more memorable than trying to learn a list of words out of context.  Speaking of context, let's talk more about that. Literally, 'context' means the text that comes before and after a particular word. It also refers to the situation in which a word is used.  Context is your friend when you're learning new vocabulary! It helps you guess the meaning of words you don't know, it shows you how a word is used in a sentence, and it helps you remember the word for longer.  This means learning vocabulary by reading and listening is more effective than trying to study word lists. It also means that it's better to make a note of how a word is used in a sentence, rather than just the word on its own. For example, instead of 'to make up = to invent', try learning, 'He'd totally made the story up!'. You've got useful information there – about the meaning, the types of things people 'make up' and the word order. Following the 'use it or lose it' principle, using words is the best way to make sure you don't forget them. So try using new vocabulary as soon as you can when you're speaking or writing in English.  Have you noticed that you often need to use the same words and phrases when you're communicating in English? It's really worth the effort to practise the most common and the most useful words for you.  Researchers have found that you need to see or hear a word on average ten times to remember it. But when you're actively making an effort with a word – for example, you ask the person you're talking to how to say something – you learn it much faster.  So, get out there! Try to get as much exposure to English as you can. And take every opportunity to communicate in English with other people. Jo Gore Which tips are most useful for improving your English vocabulary? Submitted by JimmyGuo on Sun, 03/12/2023 - 11:15 The tip Write down new words is most useful for improving my remembering of vocabulary.I usually type the new words into a dictionary to look up the meanings,listen to both American and British pronunciation and take notice of the difference. If I revise, I’ll be stressed whether I can remember them or not, instead,I spend more time learning English,without revising.

      "The word health refers to a state of complete emotional, mental, and physical well-being. Healthcare exists to help people stay well in these key areas of life. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), healthcare costs in the United States were $3.5 trillion in 2017. However, despite this expenditure, people in the U.S. have a lower life expectancy than people in other developed countries. This is due to a variety of factors, including access to healthcare and lifestyle choices. Good health is central to handling stress and living a longer, more active life. In this article, we explain the meaning of good health, the types of health a person needs to consider, and how to preserve good health. In 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined health with a phrase that modern authorities still apply. “Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” In 1986, the WHO made further clarifications: “A resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.” This means that health is a resource to support an individual’s function in wider society, rather than an end in itself. A healthful lifestyle provides the means to lead a full life with meaning and purpose. In 2009, researchers publishing inThe Lancet defined health as the ability of a body to adapt to new threats and infirmities.  They base this definition on the idea that the past few decades have seen modern science take significant strides in the awareness of diseases by understanding how they work, discovering new ways to slow or stop them, and acknowledging that an absence of pathology may not be possible.  Mental and physical health are probably the two most frequently discussed types of health.  Spiritual, emotional, and financial health also contribute to overall health. Medical experts have linked these to lower stress levels and improved mental and physical well-being. People with better financial health, for example, may worry less about finances and have the means to buy fresh food more regularly. Those with good spiritual health may feel a sense of calm and purpose that fuels good mental health. Visit our dedicated hub for an in-depth look at social disparities in health and what we can do to correct them. A person who has good physical health is likely to have bodily functions and processes working at their peak.  This is not only due not only to an absence of disease. Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate rest all contribute to good health. People receive medical treatment to maintain the balance, when necessary. Physical well-being involves pursuing a healthful lifestyle to decrease the risk of disease. Maintaining physical fitness, for example, can protect and develop the endurance of a person’s breathing and heart function, muscular strength, flexibility, and body composition. Looking after physical health and well-being also involves reducing the risk of an injury or health issue, such as: Good physical health can work in tandem with mental health to improve a person’s overall quality of life.  For example, mental illness, such as depression, may increase the risk of drug use disorders, according to a 2008 study. This can go on to adversely affect physical health. According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, mental health refers to a person’s emotional, social, and psychological well-being. Mental health is as important as physical health as part of a full, active lifestyle. It is harder to define mental health than physical health because many psychological diagnoses depend on an individual’s perception of their experience.  With improvements in testing, however, doctors are now able to identify some physical signs of some types of mental illness in CT scans and genetic tests. Good mental health is not only categorized by the absence of depression, anxiety, or another disorder. It also depends on a person’s ability to:  Physical and mental health have strong connections. For example, if a chronic illness affects a person’s ability to complete their regular tasks, it may lead to depression and stress. These feelings could be due to financial problems or mobility issues. A mental illness, such as depression or anorexia, can affect body weight and overall function. It is important to approach “health” as a whole, rather than as a series of separate factors. All types of health are linked, and people should aim for overall well-being and balance as the keys to good health. Find out how mental health can affect physical health here. Good health depends on a wide range of factors. A person is born with a variety of genes. In some people, an unusual genetic pattern or change can lead to a less-than-optimum level of health. People may inherit genes from their parents that increase their risk for certain health conditions. Environmental factors play a role in health. Sometimes, the environment alone is enough to impact health. Other times, an environmental trigger can cause illness in a person who has an increased genetic risk of a particular disease. Access to healthcare plays a role, but the WHO suggest that the following factors may have a more significant impact on health than this: It is possible to categorize these as follows: According to some studies, the higher a person’s socioeconomic status (SES), the more likely they are to enjoy good health, have a good education, get a well-paid job, and afford good healthcare in times of illness or injury. They also maintain that people with low socioeconomic status are more likely to experience stress due to daily living, such as financial difficulties, marital disruption, and unemployment. Social factors may also impact on the risk of poor health for people with lower SES, such as marginalization and discrimination. A low SES often means reduced access to healthcare. A 2018 study in Frontiers in Pharmacology indicated that people in developed countries with universal healthcare services have longer life expectancies than those in developed countries without universal healthcare. Cultural issues can affect health. The traditions and customs of a society and a family’s response to them can have a good or bad impact on health. According to the Seven Countries Study, researchers studied people in select European countries and found that those who ate a healthful diet had a lower 20-year death rate.  The study indicated that people who ate a healthful diet are more likely to consume high levels of fruits, vegetables, and olives than people who regularly consume fast food. The study also found that people who followed the Mediterranean diet had a lower 10-year all-cause mortality rate. According to the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, this diet can help protect a person’s heart and reduce the risk of several diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, and diseases that cause the brain and nerves to break down. How a person manages stress will also affect their health. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, people who smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or take illicit drugs to manage stressful situations are more likely to develop health problems than those who manage stress through a healthful diet, relaxation techniques, and exercise. The best way to maintain health is to preserve it through a healthful lifestyle rather than waiting until sickness or infirmity to address health problems. People use the name wellness to describe this continuous state of enhanced well-being. The WHO define wellness as follows: “Wellness is the optimal state of health of individuals and groups. There are two focal concerns: the realization of the fullest potential of an individual physically, psychologically, socially, spiritually, and economically, and the fulfillment of one’s roles and expectations in the family, community, place of worship, and other settings.” Wellness promotes active awareness of and participating in measures that preserve health, both as an individual and in the community. Maintaining wellness and optimal health is a lifelong, daily commitment. Steps that can help people attain wellness include: The definition of peak health is highly individual, as are the steps a person may take to get there. Every person has different health goals and a variety of ways to achieve them. It may not be possible to avoid disease altogether. However, a person should do as much as they can to develop resilience and prepare the body and mind to deal with illnesses as they arise. Learn more about the health benefits of socializing here.

      "\t\t\t\tU.S. Students Studying Abroad from 2014-2019.\t\t\t \n",
      "\t\t\t\tU.S. Students Studying Abroad from 2014-2019.\t\t\t It is surprising to note that there is not much variance in the top destinations over the last five or even ten years. The same ten countries have made up the “Top 10 destinations” for the last five years, albeit in slightly different orders. There is a clear “Big 3” for U.S. students that each represent around 10% of all students studying abroad — United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain and they’ve stayed in those top 3 slots over the last ten decades.  American students consider these destinations of historical and cultural significance – particularly The U.K., thanks to its cultural ties with the U.S., while Italy is a popular destination for students studying, History, Art and Design. Spain has grown over the last decade to more than 30,000 US students per year. Like Italy, it is a popular destination due to its history, culture, and art. The importance of the Spanish language in the USA and surrounding region is also an essential factor. Three of the top 10 countries – the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia – represented over 61,000 students’ destinations in 2018-2019.  This is not surprising as their university sector teaches in English, mostly removing language barriers from the path of students’ success.  The only Asian country to make the Top 10 is China, popular for business studies as students seek to understand one of the world’s largest economies.  China has had the most significant fluctuation in numbers from year-to-year over the last ten years, but it has stayed relatively consistent between 11,000 and 12.000 in the latest 5-year period. The only destination in the Americas in the Top 10 is Costa Rica. This Central American country has been politically stable, and its topography and tropical ecosystems provide exciting learning opportunities. Besides, it is an inexpensive place to study the Spanish language. Here is a look at the recent student numbers for Americans attending study abroad programs in the top destination countries in for-credit programs. Study abroad was once seen as a time in a student’s (usually a well-heeled student’s) undergraduate years. The famous European cultural and political capitals were usually the key destinations. How much has that changed? Well, some, but certainly not entirely. Europe, including the United Kingdom, still accounts for more than half of all U.S. student mobility. However, programs have spread out from just the most famous cities to offer various destinations.  The table above shows that Europe still dominates, and while its total “market share” dipped from 60% to 55% over a decade, its real numbers grew. Asia and “multiple destinations” (such as “year at sea” programs) each took a couple of percentage points from Europe, but the “old world’s” draw remains powerful to U.S. students.  Latin American and Caribbean percentages remain almost unchanged; however, students’ regional choice of destination shifts due to new program offerings and political realities. One of the draws of Europe happens to be the ease of travel between countries. Already famous for its rail system and compact geography, the growth of low-cost airlines such as Ryanair has fueled a new kind of student abroad student who uses a semester program to visit multiple countries on weekends during a semester. We confess that Spain is of particular interest to us and probably to our readers. With great Southern cities for programs such as Seville and Alicante and the cosmopolitan Barcelona, it is not surprising that Spain has remained in the “Big 3” of destinations for U.S. students, with around 10% of the total. But the trend from 2008-2009 until 2018-2019 showed steady growth: Discussions with our students regarding why they choose Spain tend to revolve around the country’s lifestyle and the importance of Spanish. IIE’s “Open Doors” is a great resource to answer this question. First, keep in mind that the data in “Open Doors” is usually a couple of years old and that the COVID-19 pandemic does not represent a “typical” time, and this will be reflected in future “Open Doors” figures. Sometimes people point to this number to show that Americans are not very worldly.  However, given the expense of a semester abroad and the need to earn course credits, it can be considered a positive. To support this, Loncharich, Moose and Vernon reported that 63% of freshmen at college were interested in studying abroad, however only 14.3% ended up achieving to. Plus, as you’ll see below, the total numbers grew for nine consecutive years, so simply using these statistics to infer a lack of internationalization in U.S. academia is simplistic. Even with the growth in total numbers over a decade, one demographic has remained relatively steady. About 2 out of every 3 participants in U.S. study abroad programs is female – the annual figure has fallen between 64.7% and 67,3% in each of the last 17 years for which data are available.  There has even been growth in the females to males ratio over the previous several years. It is important to note that U.S. higher education has a higher proportion of females, but the difference is not as stark as the study abroad demographics. The image of study abroad going back for decades has been that its participants are from well-off, white families. Much research has supported those general impressions; however, the last decade shows a growing diversity pattern. That growth has not been fast, but the trend is clear. The latest data are reflective of the figures over the last decade. The classic timing is to do a study abroad semester in one’s junior (3rd) year of university. Along with study abroad in a senior (4th) year, this remains the most common time to go. The table below specifies what research demonstrates on the timing of a student’s time abroad. Some trends are apparent such as the growth of total participants. It does not mean that all of them are doing an entire semester abroad. The opposite is true, actually – it is clear that shorter programs now take a more significant percentage of the total. 63% of students studied abroad for just 8 weeks or less. Theories to explain it point to the expense of higher education in the USA in general; the thinking is that an entire semester abroad is often not affordable for many families struggling to pay the high cost of college. The UNC launched a study of a sample of their students in 2016 to discover their economic backgrounds. The following is the income status of the 128 students studied: The United States has been the #1 destination for international students for decades, and this was true through the 2018 / 2019 school year. Growth was not linear. Important factors are: Even things like the price of oil are influential, as it affects the ability of oil states’ – such as Saudi Arabia – to sponsor their citizens through scholarships. Over the last ten years, the trend has been mostly upward, starting at around 650,00 and ending at approximately 900,000 accepted applicants per year. The USA has seen mostly steady growth in total numbers of international students since 1950, as this graphic illustrates. Universities like the diversity on campus as well as the financial benefit of having international students. In the USA, students can often participate in what is called “Optional Practical Training” – legal work – as their right as a student visa holder. These periods can be from 1 to 3 years (recent years, so an increase in the number of months of employment permitted growth for STEM area students in graduate fields).  In fact, 53% of those students specialized in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). International students are now more aware of this possibility, and universities use success in this area as a recruiting message. These factors have meant growth from 76,031 participants in the 2010 / 2011 school year to over 220,000 a decade later.  Especially in the information technology field, some companies use OPT as a trial period for new employees. If the companies are impressed with a student’s work, they may take the time and expense to sponsor their immigration efforts. The current trend is that a little more than half come from just two countries: China (primarily undergraduate) and India (mostly graduate level) and the other half from everywhere else. South Korea also represents a significant number, at five percent. \n",
      "\t\t\t\tTop 10 Places of Origin for International Students in U.S.\t\t\t \n",
      "\t\t\t\tTop 10 Places of Origin for International Students in U.S.\t\t\t There has been no great change in the names that appear over the last 20 years. Once dominated by the north-east, California now has several institutions competing for international students, as well as a few in Texas. Engineering, Math, and Computer Sciences are the standout fields of study. Math and computer science in particular has seen tremendous growth, from 57,266 students in 2000 to 205,207 in 2020 – a growth of 258%, the real bulk of the growth coming between 2010 and 2020. Although not quite as remarkable as math and computer science, engineering has jumped from 76,834 students in 2000, to 220,542 in 2020 – a growth of 187% In the following section, we will look at what academic research has demonstrated about the value of studying abroad. Many international education professionals point to hard-to-calculate benefits such as greater cultural awareness, increased self-confidence, improved independence, and growth in knowledge of one’s own and your host country’s culture. Several years ago IES conducted a survey of more than 3,400 study abroad students. From their research, the following conclusions can be drawn: Academics have found clear links in language learning when students are put into an immersion environment, such as studying Spanish in Spain or Latin America.  But what about overall intellectual and academic development? Study Abroad appears to add to success in these areas; this article is not intended for deep analysis, but we can point the reader to academic research to back up some key conclusions. A University of Minnesota study demonstrated that study abroad improves graduation rates. It was shown through longitudinal research with thousands of data points and across various demographic groups. Research at community colleges in California demonstrated many positive outcomes related to study abroad. These included better GPAs, higher completion rates of 2-year degrees, and a higher transfer rate to 4-year institutions for Bachelor’s degrees. The GLOSSARI study in Georgia’s state university system attempted to measure the effect of study abroad on several areas, accounting for various potential variables. The research pointed to positive results in three areas of functional knowledge: Given that higher education in the USA is so expensive, some may be pleased with the research results on intellectual and academic success. However, does studying abroad help you to get a job and succeed in your career? It’s a complicated question to answer because employment success has many variables associated with it. First, let’s take a look at a 2014 study that sought to assess the “business needs of employees with international expertise” through surveying companies. Among its findings were the following: The European Commission also released the following findings as part of its Erasmus Impact Survey: There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that studying abroad results in greater opportunities for participants: Student mobility has grown in almost all regions of the globe. The USA has benefited from the knowledge and experiences that its students have overseas.  It also profits from international students who bring billions of dollars in economic benefits and expose American students to new cultures and perspectives.  1) Study abroad leads to an improvement in many soft skills, such as working and interacting with people from a diverse range of cultures. 2) The most popular European destinations for US Students are England, Spain, and Italy. 3) Study abroad helps you to dramatically improve your language skills and communication. 4) Study Abroad continues to grow year on year for US students. 5) As work becomes more global, study abroad takes an increasingly vital role in the preparation of our students.

Good habits vs. bad habits Quitting bad habits Starting 48 good habits Build a life of good habits “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is not an act, but a habit.” — Aristotle Often, when we think of changing our habits, we think of good habits vs. bad habits. Smoking versus quitting smoking. Biting your nails versus leaving your fingers alone.  Staring at your screen right before bed versus putting your phone down and practicing good sleep hygiene. Although behavior change is important for negative habits, it’s just as important to focus your attention on building good habits. Developing good habits can create meaningful, positive change in your life. Forming those kinds of positive habits is an ongoing process that takes time and commitment. Let’s take a look at some good habits you can develop that have the power to improve both your physical and mental well-being. We’ll also give you tips to drop bad habits to make way for habits that promote personal development. Before we dive into the power of habit, it’s important to understand what habits are. Habits are behaviors or actions you perform regularly. Some might be habits you do at work, such as leadership behaviors. Others might be actions you do in the morning while getting ready for the day. These kinds of rituals happen automatically. We do them instinctively, almost without thinking. Although we do them subconsciously, you do have control over your habits. Habits don't just simply appear. They're learned behaviors that work almost like a reflex over time. These repetitive actions are triggered by a certain context or automatic thought pattern.  For example, brushing your teeth is a daily habit. After eating breakfast, your brain knows that the next step is to go to the bathroom. Muscle memory takes over as you put the toothpaste on your toothbrush and you start brushing your teeth. You’ve done it so many times before, at roughly the same time on a daily basis, that it becomes a natural part of your daily routine. This kind of repetitive consistency has turned the action into a habit.  So why should you start thinking actively about your current habits? Simple — because habits are incredibly powerful parts of our lives. Once we become more mindful of our habits and daily actions, we can make improvements where we see fit. Try to practice mindfulness and healthy curiosity toward your everyday behaviors.  What are the bad habits you do instinctively that you would like to change?  What habits do you already have that you’re proud of? How can you build on those good habits even more? Being aware of your current habits is the first step toward changing your behavior for the better. You have the power to transform your life through the power of habits.  The idea of a habit is quite simple, but its formation is scientific. Because of the power habits have over our lives, there are many studies on the neurobiological processes related to habits. All habits start as part of a psychological pattern, also called a habit loop.  James Clear focuses on this habit loop in his best-selling book, “Atomic Habits.” He draws on neuroscience and psychology to explain how this loop is made of four important components: Let’s look at drinking coffee every morning as an example of a habit.  When you walk into your kitchen, the cue might be your coffee machine. Whether you’re aware of it or not, seeing your coffee machine sparks a craving. Seeing the coffee machine makes you envision the smell, taste, and feeling of a hot cup of coffee. This desire leads to action.  Your response is to take out some coffee grounds and turn on the machine to get the coffee brewing.  Finally, you can receive your reward. A hot cup of coffee. Tomorrow, the craving will happen again, and the feedback loop continues. This four-step process of how we form and break habits is extremely important for understanding why we do what we do. Without being aware of the cues behind our habits, there’s little chance of changing our habits.  This cycle has the power to change what we do in our everyday lives. And in turn, that gives us more control over our self-management and what actions we take.  Not all habits are beneficial to us. It’s important to decipher between good habits and bad habits. This way, you can work on building good habits that bring positive results and breaking bad habits that don’t serve you. Good habits are those repetitive actions or behaviors you want to repeat. They have positive physical, emotional, or psychological consequences.  Bad habits are those actions you repeat that have negative consequences. Some bad habits are harmless, while others can have a deeper, long-term impact. Many of our habits are formed without us even realizing it. Our brains go into autopilot. This can make it difficult to know which of our habits are bad or good.  To determine whether a habit is good or bad, think about the effects of the habit. Ask yourself some of these questions: Once you’ve realized your good habits from bad habits, it’s time to rewire your brain. Here’s how you can break those bad habits. With determination, resilience, and the right mindset, you can break nearly any bad habit. Here are some tips on how to stop harmful habits: The habit loop always starts with a cue. This trigger is what gets the bad habit in motion. Pay attention to what triggers your bad habit. Once you are aware of what causes the habit, you can react appropriately. You can either take yourself out of the situation, or you can be more mindful of your determination to end a bad habit. For example, being around others who smoke may trigger your desire to smoke. If you want to break your habit of smoking, remove yourself from the situation completely. If that’s not possible, be mindful of your cravings and remind yourself of why you want to quit smoking. Mindfulness is a great tool for breaking habits.  Practicing mindfulness has been shown to activate the brain’s prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is associated with concentration, planning, and decision-making.  When we’re more aware of our thoughts, we can make better decisions, even in the face of unhealthy cravings and temptations.  When you feel yourself wanting to revert to a bad habit, make a note of your thoughts and feelings. Become present in the moment. Be curious and aware of your thoughts and bodily sensations. Because self-awareness is so important in breaking the bad habit cycle, use reminders. Leave notes for yourself in the place your bad habit usually happens. This will help you rethink the action before doing it. For example, leave encouraging sticky notes on your fridge to remind yourself to eat healthily. This kind of visual reminder can prompt you to reach for healthy foods that are good for concentration instead of a sugary treat. Keep in mind that the amount of time it takes to break a habit will depend on the habit. Need some inspiration on healthy habits you can build? Here’s a good habits list to help you get started. Remember, habits don’t just happen. They are made. You have the power to build new habits and break old ones.  The best habit you can build is the habit of forming new, positive habits.   Humans are creatures of habit. Our habits, both good and bad, shape our attitudes and actions. They can determine our success or failure. Forming good habits takes time, patience, and self-discipline. But a life filled with positive habits has the power to create real, positive change. Building good habits is an important aspect of personal growth. Now that you know more about good habits, it’s time to make a change. What are the bad habits that you would like to break? And what good habits are you going to develop? Get in touch with a BetterUp Coach. We’ll help you develop good habits and guide you every step of the way.

      "Lebanon (/ˈlɛbənɒn, -nən/ ⓘ LEB-ə-non, -⁠nən; Arabic: لُبْنَان, romanized: Lubnān, local pronunciation: [lɪbˈneːn]), officially the Republic of Lebanon,[c] is a country in the Levant region of West Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east, by Israel to the south, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the west; Cyprus lies a short distance away from the country's coastline. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterlands has contributed to the country's rich history and shaped a unique cultural identity denoted by religious diversity.[13] Located in the Levant region of the Eastern Mediterranean, the country has a population of more than five million people and covers an area of 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi). Lebanon's capital and largest city is Beirut, followed by Tripoli and Jounieh. While Arabic is the official language, French is also recognized in a formal capacity; Lebanese Arabic is the country's vernacular, though French and English play a relatively significant role in everyday life,[14] with Modern Standard Arabic being limited to news and government matters.\n",
      " The earliest evidence of human civilization in Lebanon dates back to 5000 BCE.[15] From 3200 to 539 BC, Lebanon was home to Phoenicia, a maritime empire that stretched the Mediterranean Basin.[16] In 64 BC, the Roman Empire conquered the region, and Lebanon soon became a major center for Christianity under the aegis of the Byzantine Empire. In the 7th century, the Muslim conquest of the Levant brought the region under the control of the Rashidun Caliphate. The 11th century saw the beginning of the Crusades and the establishment of Crusader states, though these later fell to the Ayyubids and the Mamluks, who in turn ceded the territory to the Ottoman Turks in the aftermath of the Ottoman–Mamluk War of 1516–1517. Under Ottoman ruler Abdulmejid I, the first Lebanese proto-state was established in the form of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, created in the 19th century as a home for Maronite Christians under the Ottoman \"Tanzimat\" period.\n",
      " After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire around World War I, the five Ottoman provinces constituting modern-day Lebanon came under the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, to be administered by France. Under the Mandate administration, France established Greater Lebanon as the predecessor state to today's independent Lebanon. However, French rule over the region weakened significantly in the aftermath of the German invasion of France in 1940. By 1943, Lebanon had gained independence from Free France and subsequently established a distinct form of confessionalist government, with the state's major religious groups being apportioned specific political powers. The new Lebanese state was relatively stable for a short period after independence,[17] but this was ultimately shattered by the outbreak of large-scale fighting in the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) between various political and sectarian factions. Amidst the internal hostilities of this period, Lebanon was also subjugated by two overlapping military occupations: by Syria from 1976 to 2005 and by Israel from 1985 to 2000. Since the end of the conflict, there have been extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure.[18]\n",
      " Lebanon is a developing country, ranked 112th on the Human Development Index.[19] It has been classified as an upper-middle-income state.[20] However, the Lebanese liquidity crisis, coupled with nationwide corruption and recent disasters such as the 2020 Beirut explosion, have precipitated the collapse of Lebanon's currency and fomented political instability, widespread resource shortages, and high unemployment and poverty. The World Bank has defined Lebanon's economic crisis as one of the world's worst since the 19th century.[21][22] Despite the country's small size,[23] Lebanese culture is renowned both in the Arab world and globally, powered primarily by the Lebanese diaspora.[24] Lebanon is a founding member of the United Nations and of the Arab League,[25] and is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, and the Group of 77, among others.\n",
      " The name of Mount Lebanon originates from the Phoenician root lbn (𐤋𐤁𐤍) meaning \"white\", apparently from its snow-capped peaks.[26][27]\n",
      " Occurrences of the name have been found in different Middle Bronze Age texts from the library of Ebla,[28] and three of the twelve tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n",
      "The name is recorded in Ancient Egyptian as Rmnn (𓂋𓏠𓈖𓈖𓈉), where R stood for Canaanite L.[29]\n",
      "The name occurs nearly 70 times in the Hebrew Bible, as לְבָנוֹן.[30]\n",
      " Lebanon as the name of an administrative unit (as opposed to the mountain range) that was introduced with the Ottoman reforms of 1861, as the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate (Arabic: متصرفية جبل لبنان; Turkish: Cebel-i Lübnan Mutasarrıflığı), continued in the name of the State of Greater Lebanon (Arabic: دولة لبنان الكبير Dawlat Lubnān al-Kabīr; French: État du Grand Liban) in 1920, and eventually in the name of the sovereign Republic of Lebanon (Arabic: الجمهورية اللبنانية al-Jumhūrīyah al-Lubnānīyah) upon its independence in 1943.[citation needed]\n",
      " The borders of contemporary Lebanon are a product of the Treaty of Sèvres of 1920. Its territory was in the core of the Bronze Age Canaanite (Phoenician) city-states. As part of the Levant, it was part of numerous succeeding empires throughout ancient history, including the Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Achaemenid, Hellenistic, Sasanian and Roman empires.\n",
      " After the 7th-century Muslim conquest of the Levant, it was part of the Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Fatimid and Seljuk empires. The crusader state of the County of Tripoli, founded by Raymond IV of Toulouse in 1102, encompassed most of present-day Lebanon, falling to the Mamluk Sultanate in 1289 and finally to the Ottoman Empire in 1516.[31] With the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, Greater Lebanon fell under French mandate in 1920,[32] and gained independence under president Bechara El Khoury in 1943. Lebanon's history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of relative political stability and prosperity based on Beirut's position as a regional center for finance and trade, interspersed with political turmoil and armed conflict (1948 Arab–Israeli War, Lebanese Civil War 1975–1990, 2005 Cedar Revolution, 2006 Lebanon War, 2007 Lebanon conflict, 2006–08 Lebanese protests, 2008 conflict in Lebanon, 2011 Syrian Civil War spillover, and 2019–20 Lebanese protests).[33]\n",
      " Evidence dating back to an early settlement in Lebanon was found in Byblos, considered among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.[15] The evidence dates back to earlier than 5000 BC. Archaeologists discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors, primitive weapons, and burial jars left by the Neolithic and Chalcolithic fishing communities who lived on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea over 7,000 years ago.[39]\n",
      " Lebanon was part of northern Canaan, and consequently became the homeland of Canaanite descendants, the Phoenicians, a seafaring people based in the coastal strip of the northern Levant who spread across the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC.[40] The most prominent Phoenician cities were Byblos, Sidon and Tyre. According to the Bible, King Hiram of Tyre collaborated closely with Solomon, supplying cedar logs for Solomon's Temple and sending skilled workers.[41] The Phoenicians are credited with the invention of the oldest verified alphabet, which subsequently inspired the Greek alphabet and the Latin one thereafter.[42]\n",
      " \n",
      "In the 9th century BC, Phoenician colonies, including Carthage in present-day Tunisia and Cádiz in present-day Spain, flourished throughout the Mediterranean. Subsequently, foreign powers, starting with the Assyrians, imposed tribute and attacked non-compliant cities. Babylonians took control in the 6th century BC.[41] In 539 BC, The cities of Phoenicia were incorporated into the Persian Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great.[43] The Phoenician city-states were later incorporated into the empire of Alexander the Great following the siege of Tyre in 332 BC.[43] In 64 BC, the Roman general Pompey the Great had the region of Syria annexed into the Roman Republic. The region was then split into two Imperial Provinces under the Roman Empire, Coele Syria and Phoenice, the latter which the land of present-day Lebanon was a part of.\n",
      " The region that is now Lebanon, as with the rest of Syria and much of Anatolia, became a major center of Christianity in the Roman Empire during the early spread of the faith. During the late 4th and early 5th century, a hermit named Maron established a monastic tradition focused on the importance of monotheism and asceticism, near the Mediterranean mountain range known as Mount Lebanon. The monks who followed Maron spread his teachings among Lebanese in the region. These Christians came to be known as Maronites and moved into the mountains to avoid religious persecution by Roman authorities.[44] During the frequent Roman–Persian Wars that lasted for many centuries, the Sassanid Persians occupied what is now Lebanon from 619 till 629.[45]\n",
      " During the 7th century, Muslim Arabs conquered Syria from the Byzantines, incorporating the region, including modern-day Lebanon, under the Islamic Caliphate.[46] In the era of Uthman's caliphate (644–656), Islam gained significant influence in Damascus, led by Mu'awiya, a relative of Uthman, serving as the governor. Mu'awiya sent forces to the coastal region of Lebanon, prompting conversions to Islam among the coastal population. However, the mountainous areas retained their Christian or other cultural practices.[41] Despite Islam and Arabic becoming officially dominant, the population's conversion from Christianity and Syriac language was gradual. The Maronite community, in particular, managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over Lebanon and Syria. The relative (but not complete) isolation of the Lebanese mountains meant the mountains served as a refuge in the times of religious and political crises in the Levant. As such, the mountains displayed religious diversity and the existence of several well-established sects and religions, notably, Maronites, Druze, Shiite Muslims, Ismailis, Alawites and Jacobites.[citation needed]\n",
      " After the Islamic conquest, Mediterranean trade declined for three centuries due to conflicts with the Byzantines. The ports of Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, and Tripoli struggled to recover, sustaining small populations under Umayyad and Abbasid rule. Christians and Jews were often obligated to pay the jizya, or poll tax levied on non-Muslims.[46] During the 980s, the Fatimid Caliphate took control of the Levant, including Mount Lebanon, resulting in the rejuvenation of Mediterranean trade along the Lebanese coast through renewed connections with Byzantium and Italy. This resurgence saw Tripoli and Tyre flourishing well into the 11th century, focusing on exports such as textiles, sugar, and glassware.[46]\n",
      " \n",
      "During the 11th century, the Druze religion emerged from a branch of Shia Islam. The new religion gained followers in the southern portion of Mount Lebanon. The southern portion of Mount Lebanon was ruled by Druze feudal families till the early 14th century. The Maronite population increased gradually in Northern Mount Lebanon and the Druze have remained in Southern Mount Lebanon until the modern era. Keserwan, Jabal Amel and the Beqaa Valley was ruled by Shia feudal families under the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire. Major cities on the coast, Sidon, Tyre, Acre, Tripoli, Beirut, and others, were directly administered by the Muslim Caliphs and the people became more fully absorbed by the Arab culture. Following the fall of Roman Anatolia to the Muslim Turks, the Byzantines put out a call to the Pope in Rome for assistance in the 11th century. The result was a series of wars known as the Crusades launched by the Franks from Western Europe to reclaim the former Byzantine Christian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially Syria and Palestine (the Levant). The First Crusade succeeded in temporarily establishing the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli as Roman Catholic Christian states along the coast.[47] These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region, though their control was limited, and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks.\n",
      " Among the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks (i.e., the French) and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the Eastern Mediterranean, who swore allegiance to Constantinople or other local patriarchs, the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from France and Italy, even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.\n",
      " In 1516, Lebanon became part of the Ottoman Empire, with governance administered indirectly through local emirs.[48] Lebanon's area was organized into provinces: Northern and Southern Mount Lebanon, Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley, and Jabal Amil. \n",
      " In 1590, Druze tribal leader Fakhr al-Din II succeeded Korkmaz in southern Mount Lebanon and quickly asserted his authority as the paramount emir of the Druze in the Shouf region. Eventually, he was appointed Sanjak-bey, overseeing various Ottoman sub-provinces and tax collection. Expanding his influence extensively, he even constructed a fort in Palmyra.[49] However, this expansion raised concerns for Ottoman Sultan Murad IV, leading to a punitive expedition in 1633. Fakhr al-Din II was captured, imprisoned for two years, and subsequently executed in April 1635, along with one of his sons.[50] Surviving members of his family continued to govern a reduced area under closer Ottoman supervision until the late 17th century. On the death of the last Maan emir, various members of the Shihab clan ruled Mount Lebanon until 1830.\n",

      "While the history of Druze-Christian relations in Lebanon has generally been marked by harmony and peaceful coexistence,[51][52][53][54] though there were occasional periods of tension, notably during the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, during which around 10,000 Christians were killed by the Druze.[55] Shortly afterwards, the Emirate of Mount Lebanon, which lasted about 400 years, was replaced by the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, as a result of a European-Ottoman treaty called the Règlement Organique. The Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate[56][57][58] (1861–1918, Arabic: متصرفية جبل لبنان; Turkish: Cebel-i Lübnan Mutasarrıflığı) was one of the Ottoman Empire's subdivisions following the Tanzimat reform. After 1861 there existed an autonomous Mount Lebanon with a Christian mutasarrıf, which had been created as a homeland for the Maronites under European diplomatic pressure following the 1860 massacres. The Maronite Catholics and the Druze founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the \"Maronite-Druze dualism\" in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate.[59] The Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and Jabal Amel was ruled intermittently by various Shia feudal families, especially the Al Ali Alsagheer in Jabal Amel that remained in power until 1865 when Ottomans took direct ruling of the region. Youssef Bey Karam,[63] a Lebanese nationalist played an influential role in Lebanon's independence during this era.\n",
      " Lebanon experienced profound devastation in the First World War when the Ottoman army assumed direct control, disrupting supplies and confiscating animals, ultimately leading to a severe famine.[48] During the war, approximately 100,000 people in Beirut and Mount Lebanon died due to starvation.[64]\n",
      " Amidst the height of the First World War, the Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916, a secret pact between Britain and France, delineated Lebanon and its surrounding areas as regions open to potential French influence or control.[48] After the Allies emerged victorious in the war, the Ottoman Empire ultimately collapsed, losing control over the area. Soon after the war, Patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek, representing the Maronite Christians,  successfully campaigned for an expanded territory at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, also including areas with significant Muslim and Druze populations in addition to the Christian-dominated Mount Lebanon.[48]\n",
      " In 1920, King Faisal I proclaimed the Arab Kingdom of Syria's independence and asserted control over Lebanon. However, following a defeat to the French at the Battle of Maysalun, the kingdom was dissolved.[48] Around the same time, at the San Remo Conference, tasked with deciding the fate of former Ottoman territories, it was determined that Syria and Lebanon would fall under French rule; Shortly afterward, the formal division of territories took place in the Treaty of Sèvres, signed a few months later.[48]\n",
      " On September 1, 1920, Greater Lebanon, or Grand Liban, was officially established under French control as a League of Nations Mandate, following the terms outlined in the proposed Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. Greater Lebanon united the regions of Mount Lebanon, North Lebanon, South Lebanon, and the Bekaa, with Beirut as its designated capital.[65][48] These specified boundaries later evolved into the present-day configuration of Lebanon. This arrangement was later ratified in July 1922.[48] The Lebanese Republic was officially proclaimed on September 1, 1926, with the adoption of a constitution inspired by the French constitution on May 23 of the same year. While a Lebanese government was established, the country continued to be under French control.[48]\n",
      " Lebanon gained a measure of independence while France was occupied by Germany.[66] General Henri Dentz, the Vichy High commissioner for Syria and Lebanon, played a major role in the independence of the nation. The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through Syria to Iraq where they were used against British forces. The United Kingdom, fearing that Nazi Germany would gain full control of Lebanon and Syria by pressure on the weak Vichy government, sent its army into Syria and Lebanon.[67]\n",
      " After the fighting ended in Lebanon, General Charles de Gaulle visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside Lebanon, de Gaulle recognized the independence of Lebanon. On 26 November 1941, General Georges Catroux announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the Free French government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French reacted by imprisoning the new government. In the face of international pressure, the French released the government officials on 22 November 1943. The Allies occupied the region until the end of World War II.\n",
      " Following the end of World War II in Europe the French mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the League of Nations or its successor the United Nations. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: \"The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality.\"[68] So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members, as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained.[69] The last French troops withdrew in December 1946.\n",
      " Lebanon's unwritten National Pact of 1943 required that its president be Maronite Christian, its speaker of the parliament to be a Shia Muslim, its prime minister be Sunni Muslim, and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the Deputy Prime Minister be Greek Orthodox.[70]\n",
      " Lebanon's history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on Beirut's position as a regional center for finance and trade.[71]\n",
      " In May 1948, Lebanon supported neighboring Arab countries in a war against Israel. While some irregular forces crossed the border and carried out minor skirmishes against Israel, it was without the support of the Lebanese government, and Lebanese troops did not officially invade.[72] Lebanon agreed to support the forces with covering artillery fire, armored cars, volunteers and logistical support.[73] On 5–6 June 1948, the Lebanese army – led by the then Minister of National Defense, Emir Majid Arslan – captured Al-Malkiyya. This was Lebanon's only success in the war.[74]\n",
      " 100,000 Palestinians fled to Lebanon because of the war. Israel did not permit their return after the cease-fire.[75] As of 2017 between 174,000 and 450,000 Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon with about half in refugee camps (although these are often decades old and resemble neighborhoods).[76] Palestinians often cannot obtain Lebanese citizenship or even Lebanese identity cards and are legally barred from owning property or performing certain occupations (including law, medicine, and engineering).[77] According to Human Rights Watch, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon live in \"appalling social and economic conditions.\"\n",
      " In 1958, during the last months of President Camille Chamoun's term, an insurrection broke out, instigated by Lebanese Muslims who wanted to make Lebanon a member of the United Arab Republic. Chamoun requested assistance, and 5,000 United States Marines were briefly dispatched to Beirut on 15 July. After the crisis, a new government was formed, led by the popular former general Fouad Chehab.\n",
      " Until the early 1970s, Lebanon was dubbed \"the Switzerland of the Middle East\" for its unique status as both a snow-capped holiday destination and secure banking hub for Gulf Arabs.[78] With the 1970 defeat of the PLO in Jordan, many Palestinian militants relocated to Lebanon, increasing their armed campaign against Israel. The relocation of Palestinian bases also led to increasing sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions.\n",
      " \n",
      "In 1975, following increasing sectarian tensions, largely boosted by Palestinian militant relocation into South Lebanon, a full-scale civil war broke out in Lebanon. The Lebanese Civil War pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the PLO, left-wing Druze and Muslim militias. In June 1976, Lebanese President Élias Sarkis asked for the Syrian Army to intervene on the side of the Christians and help restore peace.[79] In October 1976 the Arab League agreed to establish a predominantly Syrian Arab Deterrent Force, which was charged with restoring calm.[80] PLO attacks from Lebanon into Israel in 1977 and 1978 escalated tensions between the countries. On 11 March 1978, 11 Fatah fighters landed on a beach in northern Israel and hijacked two buses full of passengers on the Haifa – Tel-Aviv road, shooting at passing vehicles in what became known as the Coastal Road massacre. They killed 37 and wounded 76 Israelis before being killed in a firefight with Israeli forces.[81] Israel invaded Lebanon four days later in Operation Litani. The Israeli Army occupied most of the area south of the Litani River. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 425 calling for immediate Israeli withdrawal and creating the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), charged with attempting to establish peace. Israeli forces withdrew later in 1978, but retained control of the southern region by managing a 19-kilometre-wide (12 mi) security zone along the border. These positions were held by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a Christian militia under the leadership of Major Saad Haddad backed by Israel. The Israeli Prime Minister, Likud's Menachem Begin, compared the plight of the Christian minority in southern Lebanon (then about 5% of the population in SLA territory) to that of European Jews during World War II.[82] The PLO routinely attacked Israel during the period of the cease-fire, with over 270 documented attacks.[83] People in Galilee regularly had to leave their homes during these shellings. Documents captured in PLO headquarters after the invasion showed they had come from Lebanon.[84] Arafat refused to condemn these attacks on the grounds that the cease-fire was only relevant to Lebanon.[85]\n",
      " \n",
      "In April 1980 the presence of UNIFIL soldiers in the buffer zone led to the At Tiri incident. On 17 July 1981, Israeli aircraft bombed multi-story apartment buildings in Beirut that contained offices of PLO associated groups. The Lebanese delegate to the United Nations Security Council claimed that 300 civilians had been killed and 800 wounded. The bombing led to worldwide condemnation, and a temporary embargo on the export of U.S. aircraft to Israel.[86] In August 1981, defense minister Ariel Sharon began to draw up plans to attack PLO military infrastructure in West Beirut, where PLO headquarters and command bunkers were located.[87] In 1982, the PLO attacks from Lebanon on Israel led to an Israeli invasion, aiming to support Lebanese forces in driving out the PLO. A multinational force of American, French and Italian contingents (joined in 1983 by a British contingent) were deployed in Beirut after the Israeli siege of the city, to supervise the evacuation of the PLO. The civil war re-emerged in September 1982 after the assassination of Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel, an Israeli ally, and subsequent fighting. During this time a number of sectarian massacres occurred, such as in Sabra and Shatila, and in several refugee camps.[88] The multinational force was withdrawn in the spring of 1984, following a devastating bombing attack during the previous year.\n",
      " During the early 1980s, Hezbollah, a Shiite Islamist militant group and political party, came into existence through the efforts of Shiite clerics who were financially supported and trained by Iran. Arising in the aftermath of the 1982 war and drawing inspiration from the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Hezbollah actively engaged in combat against Israel as well as suicide attacks, car bombings and assassinations. Their objectives encompassed eliminating Israel, fighting for the Shia cause in the Lebanese civil war, ending Western presence in Lebanon, and establishing a Shiite Khomeinist Islamic state.[89][46][90]\n",
      " \n",
      "In the late 1980s, as Amine Gemayel’s second term as president drew to an end, the Lebanese pound collapsed. At the end of 1987 US$1 was worth £L500. This meant the legal minimum wage was worth just $17 a month. Most goods in shops were priced in dollars and a Save the Children director estimated that 2–300,000 children were need of assistance and were living almost entirely on bread which was subsidized by the government. Those that could depended on foreign assistance. Hizbullah was receiving about $3–5 million a month from Iran.[91] In September 1988, the Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Gemayel as a result of differences between the Christians, Muslims, and Syrians. The Arab League Summit of May 1989 led to the formation of a Saudi–Moroccan–Algerian committee to solve the crisis. On 16 September 1989 the committee issued a peace plan which was accepted by all. A ceasefire was established, the ports and airports were re-opened and refugees began to return.[80] In the same month, the Lebanese Parliament agreed to the Taif Agreement, which included an outline timetable for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and a formula for the de-confessionalization of the Lebanese political system.[80] The civil war ended at the end of 1990 after 16 years; it had caused massive loss of human life and property and devastated the country's economy. It is estimated that 150,000 people were killed and another 200,000 wounded.[92] Nearly a million civilians were displaced by the war, and some never returned.[93] Parts of Lebanon were left in ruins.[94] The Taif Agreement has still not been implemented in full and Lebanon's political system continues to be divided along sectarian lines. Conflict between Israel and Lebanese militants continued, leading to a series of violent events and clashes including the Qana massacre.[95][96][97][98] In May 2000, Israeli forces fully withdrew from Lebanon.[99][96][100] Since then, 25 May is regarded by the Lebanese as the Liberation Day.[101][102][96] The internal political situation in Lebanon significantly changed in the early 2000s. After the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the death of former president Hafez al-Assad in 2000, the Syrian military presence faced criticism and resistance from the Lebanese population.[103]\n",
      " On 14 February 2005, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated in a car bomb explosion.[104] Leaders of the March 14 Alliance accused Syria of the attack,[105] while Syria and the March 8 Alliance claimed that Israel was behind the assassination. The Hariri assassination marked the beginning of a series of assassinations that resulted in the death of many prominent Lebanese figures.[nb 1] The assassination triggered the Cedar Revolution, a series of demonstrations which demanded the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the establishment of an international commission to investigate the assassination. Under pressure from the West, Syria began withdrawing,[106] and by 26 April 2005 all Syrian soldiers had returned to Syria.[107]\n",
      " UNSC Resolution 1595 called for an investigation into the assassination.[108] The United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission published preliminary findings on 20 October 2005 in the Mehlis report, which cited indications that the assassination was organized by Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services.[109][110][111][112]\n",
      " On 12 July 2006, Hezbollah launched a series of rocket attacks and raids into Israeli territory, where they killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others.[113] Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery fire on targets in Lebanon, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, resulting in the 2006 Lebanon War. The conflict was officially ended by the UNSC Resolution 1701 on 14 August 2006, which ordered a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, and the disarmament of Hezbollah.[114][115] Some 1,191 Lebanese[116] and 160 Israelis[117] were killed in the conflict. Beirut's southern suburb was heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes.[118]\n",
      " In 2007, the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp became the center of the 2007 Lebanon conflict between the Lebanese Army and Fatah al-Islam. At least 169 soldiers, 287 insurgents and 47 civilians were killed in the battle. Funds for the reconstruction of the area have been slow to materialize.[119] Between 2006 and 2008, a series of protests led by groups opposed to the pro-Western Prime Minister Fouad Siniora demanded the creation of a national unity government, over which the mostly Shia opposition groups would have veto power. When Émile Lahoud's presidential term ended in October 2007, the opposition refused to vote for a successor unless a power-sharing deal was reached, leaving Lebanon without a president.\n",
      " On 9 May 2008, Hezbollah and Amal forces, sparked by a government declaration that Hezbollah's communications network was illegal, seized western Beirut,[120][121] the most important Sunni center in Lebanon, leading to an intrastate military conflict.[122] The Lebanese government denounced the violence as a coup attempt.[123] At least 62 people died in the resulting clashes between pro-government and opposition militias.[124] On 21 May 2008, the signing of the Doha Agreement ended the fighting.[120][124] As part of the accord, which ended 18 months of political paralysis,[125] Michel Suleiman became president and a national unity government was established, granting a veto to the opposition.[120] The agreement was a victory for opposition forces, as the government caved in to all their main demands.[124]\n",
      " In early January 2011, the national unity government collapsed due to growing tensions stemming from the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which was expected to indict Hezbollah members for the Hariri assassination.[126] The parliament elected Najib Mikati, the candidate for the Hezbollah-led March 8 Alliance, Prime Minister of Lebanon, making him responsible for forming a new government.[127] Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah insists that Israel was responsible for the assassination of Hariri.[128] A report leaked by the Al-Akhbar newspaper in November 2010 stated that Hezbollah has drafted plans for a takeover of the country in case the Special Tribunal for Lebanon issues an indictment against its members.[129]\n",
      " In 2012, the Syrian civil war threatened to spill over in Lebanon, causing more incidents of sectarian violence and armed clashes between Sunnis and Alawites in Tripoli.[130] According to UNHCR, the number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon increased from around 250,000 in early 2013 to 1,000,000 in late 2014.[131] In 2013, The Lebanese Forces Party, the Kataeb Party and the Free Patriotic Movement voiced concerns that the country's sectarian based political system is being undermined by the influx of Syrian refugees.[132] On 6 May 2015, UNHCR suspended registration of Syrian refugees at the request of the Lebanese government.[133] In February 2016, the Lebanese government signed the Lebanon Compact, granting a minimum of €400 million of support for refugees and vulnerable Lebanese citizens.[134] As of October 2016, the government estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrians.[135]\n",
      " On 17 October 2019, the first of a series of mass civil demonstrations erupted;[136][137][138] they were initially triggered by planned taxes on gasoline, tobacco and online phone calls such as through WhatsApp,[139][140][141] but quickly expanded into a country-wide condemnation of sectarian rule,[142] a stagnant economy and liquidity crisis, unemployment, endemic corruption in the public sector,[142] legislation (such as banking secrecy) that is perceived to shield the ruling class from accountability[143][144] and failures from the government to provide basic services such as electricity, water and sanitation.[145]\n",
      " As a result of the protests, Lebanon entered a political crisis, with Prime Minister Saad Hariri tendering his resignation and echoing protestors' demands for a government of independent specialists.[146] Other politicians targeted by the protests have remained in power. On 19 December 2019, former Minister of Education Hassan Diab was designated the next prime minister and tasked with forming a new cabinet.[147] Protests and acts of civil disobedience have since continued, with protesters denouncing and condemning the designation of Diab as prime minister.[148][149][150] Lebanon is suffering the worst economic crisis in decades.[151][152] Lebanon is the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to see its inflation rate exceed 50% for 30 consecutive days, according to Steve H. Hanke, professor of applied economics at the Johns Hopkins University.[153] On 4 August 2020, an explosion at the port of Beirut, Lebanon's main port, destroyed the surrounding areas, killing over 200 people, and injuring thousands more. The cause of the explosion was later determined to be 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been unsafely stored, and accidentally set on fire that Tuesday afternoon.[154] Protests resumed within days following the explosion, which resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Hassan Diab and his cabinet on 10 August 2020, nonetheless continuing to stay in office in a caretaker capacity.[155] Demonstrations continued into 2021 with Lebanese blocking the roads with burned tires protesting against the poverty and the economic crisis.\n",
      " On 11 March 2021 the caretaker minister of energy Raymond Ghajar warned that Lebanon was threatened with \"total darkness\" at the end of March if no money was secured to buy fuel for power stations.[156] In August 2021, a large fuel explosion in northern Lebanon killed 28 people.[157]  September saw the formation of a new cabinet led by former prime minister Najib Mikati.[158] On 9 October 2021, the entire nation lost power for 24 hours after its two main power stations ran out of power due to the currency and fuel shortage.[159] Days later, sectarian violence in Beirut killed a number of people in the deadliest clashes in the country since 2008.[160] By January 2022, BBC News reported that the crisis in Lebanon had deepened further, with the value of the Lebanese pound plummeting and a scheduled general election expected to be delayed indefinitely.[161] The postponement of parliamentary elections was said to prolong the political deadlock in the country. The European Parliament called Lebanon's present situation a 'man-made disaster caused by a handful of men across the political class'.[162]\n",
      " In May 2022, Lebanon held its first election since a painful economic crisis dragged it to the brink of becoming a failed state. Lebanon's crisis has been so severe that more than 80 percent of the population is now considered poor by the United Nations. In the election the Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement (and its allies) lost their parliamentary majority. Hezbollah did not lose any of its seats, but its allies lost seats. Hezbollah's ally, President Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement, was no longer the biggest Christian party after the election. A rival Christian party, the Lebanese Forces led by Samir Geagea, became the largest Christian-based party in parliament. The Sunni Future Movement, led by former prime minister Saad Hariri, did not participate the election, leaving a political vacuum to other Sunni politicians to fill.[163][164][165] The Lebanese crisis became so severe that multiple boats left the coast holding migrants in a desperate run from the country. Many proved unsuccessful and fatal. In April 2022, 6 people died and around 50 people are rescued after an overloaded boat sinks in Tripoli.[166] And on September 22, at least 94 people were killed when a boat carrying migrants from Lebanon capsizes off Syria's coast. 9 people survived. Many were declared missing and some were found either dead or injured. Dead bodies were sent to nearby hospitals. 40 people are still missing as of 24 September.[167] On 1 February 2023, the central bank of Lebanon devalued the Lebanese pound by 90% amid the ongoing financial crisis.[168] This was the first time Lebanon had devalued its official exchange rate in 25 years.[169] As of 2023, Lebanon is considered to have become a failed state, suffering from chronic  poverty, economic mismanagement and a banking collapse.[170]\n",
      " Lebanon is located in West Asia between latitudes 33° and 35° N and longitudes 35° and 37° E. Its land straddles the \"northwest of the Arabian Plate\".[171] The country's surface area is 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi) of which 10,230 square kilometres (3,950 sq mi) is land. Lebanon has a coastline and border of 225 kilometres (140 mi) on the Mediterranean Sea to the west, a 375 kilometres (233 mi) border shared with Syria to the north and east and a 79 kilometres (49 mi) long border with Israel to the south.[172] The border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights is disputed by Lebanon in a small area called Shebaa Farms.[173]\n",
      " Lebanon is divided into four distinct physiographic regions: the coastal plain, the Lebanon mountain range, the Beqaa Valley and the Anti-Lebanon Mountains. The narrow and discontinuous coastal plain stretches from the Syrian border in the north where it widens to form the Akkar plain to Ras al-Naqoura at the border with Israel in the south. The fertile coastal plain is formed of marine sediments and river deposited alluvium alternating with sandy bays and rocky beaches. Lebanon's mountains rise steeply parallel to the Mediterranean coast and form a ridge of limestone and sandstone that runs for most of the country's length. \n",
      " The mountain range varies in width between 10 km (6 mi) and 56 km (35 mi); it is carved by narrow and deep gorges. The Lebanon mountains peak at 3,088 metres (10,131 ft) above sea level in Qurnat as Sawda' in North Lebanon and gradually slope to the south before rising again to a height of 2,695 metres (8,842 ft) in Mount Sannine. The Beqaa valley sits between the Lebanon mountains in the west and the Anti-Lebanon range in the east; it is a part of the Great Rift Valley system. The valley is 180 km (112 mi) long and 10 to 26 km (6 to 16 mi) wide, its fertile soil is formed by alluvial deposits. The Anti-Lebanon range runs parallel to the Lebanon mountains, its highest peak is in Mount Hermon at 2,814 metres (9,232 ft).[172]\n",
      " The mountains of Lebanon are drained by seasonal torrents and rivers foremost of which is the 145 kilometres (90 mi) long Leontes that rises in the Beqaa Valley to the west of Baalbek and empties into the Mediterranean Sea north of Tyre.[172] Lebanon has 16 rivers all of which are non-navigable; 13 rivers originate from Mount Lebanon and run through the steep gorges and into the Mediterranean Sea, the other three arise in the Beqaa Valley.[174]\n",
      " Lebanon has a moderate Mediterranean climate. In coastal areas, winters are generally cool and rainy whilst summers are hot and humid. In more elevated areas, temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops.[172][175] Although most of Lebanon receives a relatively large amount of rainfall, when measured annually in comparison to its arid surroundings, certain areas in north-eastern Lebanon receives only little because of the rain shadow created by the high peaks of the western mountain range.[176]\n",
      " In ancient times, Lebanon was covered by large forests of cedar trees, the national emblem of the country.[177] Millennia of deforestation have altered the hydrology in Mount Lebanon and changed the regional climate adversely.[178] As of 2012, forests covered 13.4% of the Lebanese land area;[179] they are under constant threat from wildfires caused by the long dry summer season.[180]\n",
      " As a result of longstanding exploitation, few old cedar trees remain in pockets of forests in Lebanon, but there is an active program to conserve and regenerate the forests. The Lebanese approach has emphasized natural regeneration over planting by creating the right conditions for germination and growth. The Lebanese state has created several nature reserves that contain cedars, including the Shouf Biosphere Reserve, the Jaj Cedar Reserve, the Tannourine Reserve, the Ammouaa and Karm Shbat Reserves in the Akkar district, and the Forest of the Cedars of God near Bsharri.[181][182][183] Lebanon had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 3.76/10, ranking it 141st globally out of 172 countries.[184]\n",
      " In 2010, the Environment Ministry set a 10-year plan to increase the national forest coverage by 20%, which is equivalent to the planting of two million new trees each year.[185] The plan, which was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and implemented by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), through the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative (LRI), was inaugurated in 2011 by planting cedar, pine, wild almond, juniper, fir, oak and other seedlings, in ten regions around Lebanon.[185] As of 2016, forests covered 13.6% of Lebanon, and other wooded lands represented a further 11%.[186] Since 2011, over 600,000 trees, including cedars and other native species, have been planted throughout the country as part of the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative (LRI).[187]\n",
      " Lebanon contains two terrestrial ecoregions: Eastern Mediterranean conifer–sclerophyllous–broadleaf forests and Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests.[188]\n",

      "Beirut and Mount Lebanon have been facing a severe garbage crisis. After the closure of the Bourj Hammoud dump in 1997, the al-Naameh dumpsite was opened by the government in 1998. The al-Naameh dumpsite was planned to contain 2 million tons of waste for a limited period of six years at the most. It was designed to be a temporary solution, while the government would have devised a long-term plan. Sixteen years later al-Naameh was still open and exceeded its capacity by 13 million tons. In July 2015 the residents of the area, already protesting in the recent years, forced the closure of the dumpsite. The inefficiency of the government, as well as the corruption inside of the waste management company Sukleen in charge of managing the garbage in Lebanon, have resulted in piles of garbage blocking streets in Mount Lebanon and Beirut.[189] In December 2015, the Lebanese government signed an agreement with Chinook Industrial Mining, part owned by Chinook Sciences, to export over 100,000 tons of untreated waste from Beirut and the surrounding area. The waste had accumulated in temporary locations following the government closure of the county's largest land fill site five months earlier. The contract was jointly signed with Howa International which has offices in the Netherlands and Germany. The contract is reported to cost $212 per ton. The waste, which is compacted and infectious, would have to be sorted and was estimated to be enough to fill 2,000 containers.[190] Initial reports that the waste was to be exported to Sierra Leone have been denied by diplomats.[191]\n",
      " In February 2016, the government withdrew from negotiations after it was revealed that documents relating to the export of the trash to Russia were forgeries.[192] On 19 March 2016, the Cabinet reopened the Naameh landfill for 60 days in line with a plan it passed few days earlier to end the trash crisis. The plan also stipulates the establishment of landfills in Bourj Hammoud and Costa Brava, east and south of Beirut respectively. Sukleen trucks began removing piled garbage from Karantina and heading to Naameh. Environment Minister Mohammad Machnouk announced during a chat with activists that over 8,000 tons of garbage had been collected up to that point in only 24 hours as part of the government's trash plan. The plan's execution was ongoing at last report.[193] In 2017, Human Rights Watch found that Lebanon's garbage crisis, and open burning of waste in particular, was posing a health risk to residents and violating the state's obligations under international law.[194]\n",
      " In September 2018, Lebanon's parliament passed a law that banned open dumping and burning of waste. Despite penalties set in case of violations, Lebanese municipalities have been openly burning the waste, putting the lives of people in danger. In October 2018, Human Rights Watch researchers witnessed the open burning of dumps in al-Qantara and Qabrikha.[195] On Sunday 13 October 2019 at night, a series of about 100 forest fires according to Lebanese Civil Defense, broke out and spread over large areas of Lebanon's forests. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Al-Hariri confirmed his contact with a number of countries to send assistance via helicopters and firefighting planes,[196] Cyprus, Jordan, Turkey and Greece participated in firefighting. According to press reports on Tuesday (15 October), fire has decreased in different places due to the rains.[197] Lebanon's ongoing economic crisis has precipitated electricity shortages, prompting an increased reliance on diesel generators and subsequently contributing to environmental deterioration and health hazards. The scarcity of power has led to a heightened contamination of water sources. The compromised infrastructure, marked by sewage infiltrating drinking water, has given rise to significant health concerns, including an increase in cases of Hepatitis A. The health service, grappling with workforce shortages due to emigration, struggles amid a growing public health crisis.[198]\n",
      " Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy that includes confessionalism.[199] The National Pact, erected in 1943, laid out a governing arrangement intended to harmonize the interests of the country's major religious groups.[200] The President has to be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi’a Muslim, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Eastern Orthodox.[201][202] This system is intended to deter sectarian conflict and to represent fairly the demographic distribution of the 18 recognized religious groups in government.[203][204]\n",
      " Until 1975, Freedom House considered Lebanon to be among only two (together with Israel) politically free countries in the Middle East and North Africa region.[205] The country lost this status with the outbreak of the Civil War, and has not regained it since. Lebanon was rated \"Partly Free\" in 2013. Even so, Freedom House still ranks Lebanon as among the most democratic nations in the Arab world.[205] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Lebanon is 2023 the second most electoral democratic country in the Middle East.[206]\n",

      "Until 2005, Palestinians were forbidden to work in over 70 jobs because they did not have Lebanese citizenship. After liberalization laws were passed in 2007, the number of banned jobs dropped to around 20.[75] In 2010, Palestinians were granted the same rights to work as other foreigners in the country.[207] Lebanon's national legislature is the unicameral Parliament of Lebanon. Its 128 seats are divided equally between Christians and Muslims, proportionately between the 18 different denominations and proportionately between its 26 regions.[208] Prior to 1990, the ratio stood at 6:5 in favor of Christians, but the Taif Agreement, which put an end to the 1975–1990 civil war, adjusted the ratio to grant equal representation to followers of the two religions.[201] The Parliament is elected for a four-year term by popular vote on the basis of sectarian proportional representation.[12] The executive branch consists of the President, the head of state, and the Prime Minister, the head of government. The parliament elects the president for a non-renewable six-year term by a two-thirds majority. The president appoints the Prime Minister,[209] following consultations with the parliament. The president and the prime minister form a cabinet, which must also adhere to the sectarian distribution set out by confessionalism.\n",
      " In an unprecedented move, the Lebanese parliament has extended its own term twice amid protests, the last being on 5 November 2014,[210] an act which comes in direct contradiction with democracy and article #42 of the Lebanese constitution as no elections have taken place.[6] Lebanon was without a President between May 2014 and October 2016.[211][212] Nationwide elections were finally scheduled for May 2018.[213] As of August 2019, the Lebanese cabinet included two ministers directly affiliated with Hezbollah, in addition to a close but officially non-member minister.[214] The most recent parliamentary elections were held on 15 May 2022.[215]\n",
      " There are 18 officially recognized religious groups in Lebanon, each with its own family law legislation and set of religious courts.[216] The Lebanese legal system is based on the French system, and is a civil law country, with the exception for matters related to personal status (succession, marriage, divorce, adoption, etc.), which are governed by a separate set of laws designed for each sectarian community. For instance, the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the Sharia law.[217] \n",
      "For Muslims, these tribunals deal with questions of marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills. For non-Muslims, personal status jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody. Catholics can additionally appeal before the Vatican Rota court.[218]\n",
      " The most notable set of codified laws is the Code des Obligations et des Contrats promulgated in 1932 and equivalent to the French Civil Code.[217] Capital punishment is still de facto used to sanction certain crimes, but no longer enforced.[217] The Lebanese court system consists of three levels: courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the court of cassation. The Constitutional Council rules on constitutionality of laws and electoral frauds. There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities, with rules on matters such as marriage and inheritance.[219]\n",
      " In 1990, article 95 was amended to provide that the parliament shall take necessary measures to abolish political structure based on religious affiliation, but that until such time only the highest positions in public civil service, including the judiciary, military, security forces, public and mixed institutions, shall be divided equally between Christians and Muslims without regard to the denominational affiliation within each community.[220]\n",

      " Lebanon's constitution states that 'the economic system is free and ensures private initiative and the right to private property'. Lebanon's economy follows a laissez-faire model.[234] Most of the economy is dollarized, and the country has no restrictions on the movement of capital across its borders.[234] The Lebanese government's intervention in foreign trade is minimal.[234] The Investment Development Authority of Lebanon was established with the aim of promoting investment in Lebanon. In 2001, Investment Law No.360[235] was enacted to reinforce the organisation's mission.\n",

By 2019, insufficient new deposits led to an unsustainable situation, resulting in weeks-long bank closures, arbitrary capital controls, and ultimately, the country's default in 2020.[238]\n",
      " Throughout the Ottoman and French mandatory periods and into the 1960s, Lebanon experienced prosperity, serving as a hub for banking, financial services, and a key distribution center for the Middle East. The local economy thrived with a foundation in industries related to food processing, clothing, jewelry, and carpets. This prosperity was later marred by four decades of conflict.[200] Following the end of the civil war, Lebanon has developed a service-based economy centered around finance, real estate, and tourism.[239] Nearly 65% of the Lebanese workforce attain employment in the services sector.[240] The GDP contribution, accordingly, amounts to roughly 67.3% of the annual Lebanese GDP.[17] However, dependence on the tourism and banking sectors leaves the economy vulnerable to political instability.[18]\n",
      " The urban population in Lebanon is noted for its commercial enterprise.[241] Emigration has yielded Lebanese \"commercial networks\" throughout the world.[242] In 2008, Remittances from Lebanese abroad totalled $8.2 billion[243] and account for one-fifth of the country's economy.[244] In 2005, Lebanon had the largest proportion of skilled labor among Arab States.[245]\n",
      " The agricultural sector in Lebanon employs 20-25% of the total workforce,[246] and contributed 3.1% to the country's GDP,[247] as of 2020. Lebanon has the highest proportion of cultivable land in the Arab world.[248] Major crops include apples, peaches, oranges, and lemons.[17] A significant portion of the country's factories, approximately one-third, is dedicated to producing packaged food items, ranging from poultry to pickles.[246] However, despite favorable conditions for farming and diverse microclimates, the country depends on food imports, constituting 80% of its consumption. This is mainly attributed to the small scale of many farms, preventing the benefits of economies of scale.[246] The ongoing economic crisis and devaluation of the Lebanese pound have also negatively impacted the agricultural sector, particularly through elevated costs for essential imports such as seeds and fertilizers. This economic strain compounds existing burdens for farmers, including escalating debts and inefficient agricultural practices. Consequently, farmers are observing a decline in revenues and encountering difficulties in meeting loan repayment obligations.[246][249]\n",

      " Oil has recently been discovered inland and in the seabed between Lebanon, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt and talks are underway between Cyprus and Egypt to reach an agreement regarding the exploration of these resources. The seabed separating Lebanon and Cyprus is believed to hold significant quantities of crude oil and natural gas.[251] On 10 May 2013, the Lebanese minister of energy and water clarified that seismic images of the Lebanese sea bed are undergoing detailed explanation of their contents and that up till now, approximately 10% have been covered. Preliminary inspection of the results showed, with over 50% probability, that 10% of Lebanon's exclusive economic zone held up to 660 million barrels of oil and up to 30×1012 cu ft of gas.[252]\n",
      " Lebanon has a significant drug industry, including both production and trade. Western intelligence estimate an annual production of over 4 million pounds of hashish and 20,000 pounds of heroin, generating profits exceeding $4 billion. In recent decades, Hezbollah has intensified its engagement in the drug economy, with narcotics serving as a significant revenue stream for the group. Despite some of the harvest being retained for local use, a significant amount is smuggled worldwide. Despite ongoing efforts, the government's inability to control the drug-producing Beqaa Valley and address illicit Captagon factories allows for the persistent occurrence of drug trades, impacting Lebanon's economy and regional stability.[253][254][255]\n",

      "The 1975–1990 civil war heavily damaged Lebanon's economic infrastructure,[222] cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's position as a West Asian entrepôt and banking hub.[12] The subsequent period of relative peace enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut, begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers, with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm exports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign exchange.[258] Until July 2006, Lebanon enjoyed considerable stability, Beirut's reconstruction was almost complete,[259] and increasing numbers of tourists poured into the nation's resorts.[260] The economy witnessed growth, with bank assets reaching over 75 billion US dollars,[261] Market capitalization was also at an all-time high, estimated at $10.9 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2006.[261] The month-long 2006 war severely damaged Lebanon's fragile economy, especially the tourism sector. According to a preliminary report published by the Lebanese Ministry of Finance on 30 August 2006, a major economic decline was expected as a result of the fighting.[262]\n",
      " Over the course of 2008 Lebanon rebuilt its infrastructure mainly in the real estate and tourism sectors, resulting in a comparatively robust post war economy. Major contributors to the reconstruction of Lebanon include Saudi Arabia (with US$1.5 billion pledged),[263] the European Union (with about $1 billion)[264] and a few other Persian Gulf countries with contributions of up to $800 million.[265]\n",

      " While traditional folk music remains popular in Lebanon, modern music reconciling Western and traditional Arabic styles, pop, and fusion are rapidly advancing in popularity.[343] Lebanese artists like Fairuz, Majida El Roumi, Wadih El Safi, Sabah, Julia Boutros or Najwa Karam are widely known and appreciated in Lebanon and in the Arab world. Radio stations feature a variety of music, including traditional Lebanese, classical Arabic, Armenian[344] and modern French, English, American, and Latin tunes.[345]\n",
      " The cinema of Lebanon, according to film critic and historian, Roy Armes, was the only cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, besides the dominant Egyptian cinema,[346][347] that could amount to a national cinema.[348] Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s, and the country has produced over 500 films with many films including Egyptian filmmakers and film stars.[349] The media of Lebanon is not only a regional center of production but also the most liberal and free in the Arab world.[350] According to Press freedom's Reporters Without Borders, \"the media have more freedom in Lebanon than in any other Arab country\".[351] Despite its small population and geographic size, Lebanon plays an influential role in the production of information in the Arab world and is \"at the core of a regional media network with global implications\".[352]\n",
      " Lebanon celebrates national and both Christian and Muslim holidays. Christian holidays are celebrated following both the Gregorian calendar and Julian calendar. Greek Orthodox (with the exception of Easter), Catholics, Protestants, and Melkite Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December. Armenian Apostolic Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar. Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and Ashura (the Shiite Day of Mourning). Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day. Music festivals, often hosted at historical sites, are a customary element of Lebanese culture.[353] Among the most famous are Baalbeck International Festival, Byblos International Festival, Beiteddine International Festival, Jounieh International Festival, Broumana Festival, Batroun International Festival, Ehmej Festival, Dhour Chwer Festival and Tyr Festival.[353][354] These festivals are promoted by Lebanon's Ministry of Tourism. Lebanon hosts about 15 concerts from international performers each year, ranking 1st for nightlife in the Middle East, and 6th worldwide.[355]\n",
      " Lebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as Syria, Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus. The Lebanese national dishes are the kibbe, a meat pie made from finely minced lamb and burghul (cracked wheat), and the tabbouleh, a salad made from parsley, tomatoes, and burghul wheat.  Lebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of mezze - small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries. The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled meat or fish. In general, meals are finished with Arabic coffee and fresh fruit, though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well.\n",
      " Lebanon has six ski resorts. Because of Lebanon's unique geography, it is possible to go skiing in the morning and swimming in the Mediterranean Sea in the afternoon.[356] At the competitive level, basketball and football are among Lebanon's most popular sports. Canoeing, cycling, rafting, climbing, swimming, sailing and caving are among the other common leisure sports in Lebanon. The Beirut Marathon is held every fall, drawing top runners from Lebanon and abroad.[357]\n",
      " Rugby league is a relatively new but growing sport in Lebanon. The Lebanon national rugby league team participated in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup,[358] and narrowly missed qualification for the 2008[359] and 2013 tournaments.[360] Lebanon also took part in the 2009 European Cup where, after narrowly failing to qualify for the final, the team defeated Ireland to finish 3rd in the tournament.[361] Hazem El Masri, who was born in Tripoli, is considered to be the greatest Lebanese to ever play the game. He immigrated to Sydney, Australia from Lebanon in 1988. He became the greatest point-scorer in National Rugby League history in 2009 by scoring himself 2418 points while playing for Australian club, Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs where he also holds the record for most first grade appearances for the club with 317 games and most tries for the club with 159 tries. At international level, He also hold the records as top-try scorer with 12 tries and top-point scorer with 136 points for the Lebanese national team.[362] Lebanon participates in basketball. The Lebanese National Team qualified for the FIBA World Championship 3 times in a row.[363][364] Dominant basketball teams in Lebanon are Sporting Al Riyadi Beirut,[365] who are the Arab and Asian champions, Club Sagesse who were able to earn the Asian and Arab championships before. Fadi El Khatib is the most decorated player in the Lebanese National Basketball League.\n",
      " Football is also among the more popular sports in the country. The top football league is the Lebanese Premier League, whose most successful clubs are Al Ansar FC and Nejmeh SC. Lebanon's most notable players include Roda Antar, Youssef Mohamad, and Hassan Maatouk. In recent years, Lebanon has hosted the AFC Asian Cup[366] and the Pan Arab Games.[367][368] Lebanon hosted the 2009 Jeux de la Francophonie,[369] and have participated in every Olympic Games since its independence, winning a total of four medals.[370] Prominent Lebanese bodybuilders include Samir Bannout, Mohammad Bannout and Ahmad Haidar. Water sports have also shown to be very active in the past years, in Lebanon. Since 2012 and with the emergence of the Lebanon Water Festival NGO, more emphasis has been placed on those sports, and Lebanon has been pushed forward as a water sport destination internationally.[371] They host different contests and water show sports that encourage their fans to participate and win big.[372]\n",
      " Lebanon was ranked 92nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, down from 88th in 2019.[373][374][375] Notable scientists from Lebanon include Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah, Rammal Rammal, and Edgar Choueiri.[376][377][378]\n",
      " In 1960, a science club from a university in Beirut started a Lebanese space program called \"the Lebanese Rocket Society\". They achieved great success until 1966 where the program was stopped because of both war and external pressure.[379][380]\n",

      " – in Europe (light green & dark grey)– in the European Union (light green) Germany,[e] officially the Federal Republic of Germany,[f] is a country in the western region of Central Europe. It is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia,[g] and the most populous member state of the European Union. Germany lies between the Baltic and North Sea to the north and the Alps to the south. Its 16 constituent states have a total population of over 84 million, covering a combined area of 357,600 km2 (138,100 sq mi) and sharing land borders with Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr.\n",
      " Settlement in what is now Germany began in the Lower Paleolithic, with various tribes inhabiting it from the Neolithic onward, chiefly the Celts. Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.\n",
      " Formal unification of Germany into the modern nation-state commenced on 18 August 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North German Confederation later transformed in 1871 into the German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was in turn transformed into the semi-presidential Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, in 1949, Germany as a whole was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, known as East Germany, while Berlin continued its de jure Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of the communist led-government in East Germany, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990.\n",
      " Germany has been described as a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe. As a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer. As a developed country it offers social security, a universal health care system, and tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, European Union, NATO, Council of Europe, G7, G20, and OECD. It has the third-greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n",
      " The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[12] The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land ('the German lands') is derived from deutsch (cf. Dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc 'of the people' (from diot or diota 'people'), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic *þiudiskaz 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived from *þeudō, descended from Proto-Indo-European *tewtéh₂- 'people', from which the word Teutons also originates.[13]\n",
      " Pre-human ancestors, the Danuvius guggenmosi, who were present in Germany over 11 million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest ones to walk on two legs.[14] Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.[15] The first non-modern human fossil (the Neanderthal) was discovered in the Neander Valley.[16] Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the Swabian Jura, including 42,000-year-old flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[17] the 40,000-year-old Lion Man,[18] and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels.[19] The Nebra sky disk, created during the European Bronze Age, has been attributed to a German site.[20]\n",
      " The Germanic peoples are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age, early Iron Age, or the Jastorf culture.[21][22] From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the Celtic, Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes.[23]\n",
      " Under Augustus, the Roman Empire began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of Germania between the Rhine and Elbe rivers. In 9 AD, three Roman legions were defeated by Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.[24] The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania, and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history.[25] By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of modern Germany. However, Baden-Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been incorporated into Roman provinces.[26][27][28]\n",
      " Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[29] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria, and areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes.[26]\n",
      " Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843.[30] The eastern successor kingdom of East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[30] Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies.[31] In 996, Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture controversy.[32]\n",
      " Under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (Ostsiedlung).[33] Members of the Hanseatic League, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[34] The population declined starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–1350.[35] The Golden Bull issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors.[36]\n",
      " Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge.[37] In 1517, Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation and his translation of the Bible began the standardization of the language; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the \"Evangelical\" faith (Lutheranism), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects (cuius regio, eius religio).[38] From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.[39][40]\n",
      " The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates;[39] their mostly German-speaking rulers were able to choose Catholicism, Lutheranism, or Calvinism as their official religion.[41] The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet.[42] The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of the Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as empress consort when her husband, Francis I, became emperor.[43][44]\n",
      " From 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland.[45][46] During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.[47]\n",
      " Following the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the emperor of Austria as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of Prussia's rising influence. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich.[48][49] The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[50] In light of revolutionary movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the German question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.[51]\n",
      " King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the war with Denmark in 1864; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austria. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser, and Berlin became its capital.[52][53]\n",
      " In the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as chancellor of Germany secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[53] However, under Wilhelm II, Germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[54] A dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary; the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[55] At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.[56] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and China.[57] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), from 1904 to 1907, carried out the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples as punishment for an uprising;[58][59] this was the 20th century's first genocide.[59]\n",
      " The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[60] a general armistice ended the fighting. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Wilhelm II and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and Germany was declared a federal republic. Germany's new leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, accepting defeat by the Allies. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.[61] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific.[62]\n",
      " On 11 August 1919, President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.[63] In the subsequent struggle for power, communists seized power in Bavaria, but conservative elements elsewhere attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putsch. Street fighting in the major industrial centres, the occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops, and a period of hyperinflation followed. A debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.[64][65][66]\n",
      " The worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929. Chancellor Heinrich Brüning's government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused unemployment of nearly 30% by 1932.[67] The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after a special election in 1932 and Hindenburg appointed Hitler as chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.[68] After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights and the first Nazi concentration camp opened.[69][70] On 23 March 1933, the Enabling Act gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution,[71] and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations, and dramatically increased the country's rearmament.[72] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the Autobahn.[73]\n",
      " In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.[74] Germany also reacquired control of the Saarland in 1935,[75] remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement, and in violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939.[76] Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.[77]\n",
      " In August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.[78] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, beginning World War II in Europe;[79] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[80] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, forcing the French government to sign an armistice. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the Allied reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe; the Western allies landed in France and entered Germany despite a final German counteroffensive. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, Germany signed the surrender document on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe[79][81] and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.[82][83]\n",
      " In what later became known as the Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across Europe. The regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews, at least 130,000 Romani, 275,000 disabled, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents.[84] Nazi policies in German-occupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7 million Poles,[85] 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and 3.5 million Soviet prisoners of war.[86][82] German military casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million,[87] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[88] Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.[89]\n",
      " After Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies de jure abolished the German state and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[91] East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.[92]\n",
      " West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American Marshall Plan.[93] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor of Germany in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (Wirtschaftswunder) beginning in the early 1950s.[94] West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community.[95] On 1 January 1957, the Saarland joined West Germany.[96]\n",
      " East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the Soviet Union via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politbüro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service.[97] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[98] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the Cold War.[99]\n",
      " Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.[100] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open its border with Austria, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process culminating in the Two Plus Four Treaty under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.[101] The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, German reunification and Die Wende (\"the turning point\").[102]\n",
      " United Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of West Germany so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[103] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act (1994), Berlin again became the capital of Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.[104] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.[105][106]\n",
      " Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007,[107] and co-founding the eurozone.[108] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.[109][110]\n",
      " In the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan.[111] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.[112] During the 2015 European migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.[113]\n",
      " Germany is the seventh-largest country in Europe;[4] bordering Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria to the southeast, and Switzerland to the south-southwest. France, Luxembourg and Belgium are situated to the west, with the Netherlands to the northwest. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,022 km2 (137,847 sq mi), consisting of 348,672 km2 (134,623 sq mi) of land and 8,350 km2 (3,224 sq mi) of water.\n",

The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[114]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.[4]\n",
      " Most of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north and west to continental in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.[115]\n",
      " From February 2019 – 2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C (37.9 °F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in June 2019.[116] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[117] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[118]\n",
      " The territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial ecoregions: Atlantic mixed forests, Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, Western European broadleaf forests, and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[119] As of 2016[update] 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.[120]\n",
      " Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are conifers, particularly spruce and pine.[121] There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.[122] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.[123]\n",

      " Germany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the Bundesrat represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[4] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.[129]\n",
      " The president, currently Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.[4] The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspräsident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[130] The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the Bundestag.[4] The chancellor, currently Olaf Scholz, is the head of government and exercises executive power through his Cabinet.[4]\n",
      " Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party The Left has been a staple in the German Bundestag, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.[131][132]\n",
      " Germany is a federation and comprises sixteen constituent states which are collectively referred to as Länder.[133] Each state (Land) has its own constitution,[134] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.[133] As of 2017[update] Germany is divided into 401 districts (Kreise) at a municipal level; these consist of 294 rural districts and 107 urban districts.[135]\n",
      " Germany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law.[139] The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.[140] Germany's specialized supreme court system includes the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice for civil and criminal cases, along with the Federal Labour Court, Federal Social Court, Federal Fiscal Court, and Federal Administrative Court for other matters.[141]\n",
      " Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.[142] With the exceptions of petty crimes, tried by a single professional judge, and of serious political crimes, all charges are adjudicated by mixed tribunals where lay judges (Schöffen) and professional judges preside together.[143][144]\n",

It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[150][151][152] The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[153] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism.[154] After 1990, Germany and Russia worked together to establish a \"strategic partnership\" in which energy development became one of the most important factors. As a result of the cooperation, Germany imported most of its natural gas and crude oil from Russia.[155][156]\n",
      " Germany's development policy functions as a distinct sector within its foreign policy framework. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations.

      " In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr.[170] The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994, the term \"defence\" has been defined not only to include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017,[update] the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against Daesh, 980 in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, and 800 in Kosovo.[171][172]\n",

      " According to the 2011 census, Christianity was the largest religion in Germany, with 66.8% of respondents identifying as Christian, of which 3.8% were not church members.[233] 31.7% declared themselves as Protestants, including members of the Protestant Church in Germany (which encompasses Lutheran, Reformed, and administrative or confessional unions of both traditions) and the free churches (Evangelische Freikirchen); 31.2% declared themselves as Roman Catholics, and Orthodox believers constituted 1.3%. According to data from 2016, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Church claimed 28.5% and 27.5%, respectively, of the population.[234][235] Islam is the second-largest religion in the country.[236]\n",
      " In the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[237] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. Other religions comprise less than one per cent of Germany's population.[236]\n",
      " A study in 2018 estimated that 38% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination,[238] though up to a third may still consider themselves religious.

      " Responsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[244] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.[245] A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[244] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.[246]\n",

The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013[update].[254] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.[255]\n",

Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance).[269] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[272] When industrialisation spread across Europe, classicism and a distinctive style of historicism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gründerzeit style. Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.[269] Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.[273] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto.[274]\n",

Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as Trümmerfilm (rubble film).

      "Emotion classification, the means by which one may distinguish or contrast one emotion from another, is a contested issue in emotion research and in affective science. Researchers have approached the classification of emotions from one of two fundamental viewpoints:[citation needed]\n",
      " In discrete emotion theory, all humans are thought to have an innate set of basic emotions that are cross-culturally recognizable. These basic emotions are described as \"discrete\" because they are believed to be distinguishable by an individual's facial expression and biological processes.[1] Theorists have conducted studies to determine which emotions are basic. A popular example is Paul Ekman and his colleagues' cross-cultural study of 1992, in which they concluded that the six basic emotions are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise.[2] Ekman explains that there are particular characteristics attached to each of these emotions, allowing them to be expressed in varying degrees in a non-verbal manner.[3][4] Each emotion acts as a discrete category rather than an individual emotional state.[5]\n",
      " Humans' subjective experience is that emotions are clearly recognizable in ourselves and others. This apparent ease of recognition has led to the identification of a number of emotions that are said to be basic, and universal among all people. However, a debate among experts has questioned this understanding of what emotions are. There has been recent discussion of the progression on the different views of emotion over the years.[6]\n",
      " On \"basic emotion\" accounts, activation of an emotion, such as anger, sadness, or fear, is \"triggered\" by the brain's appraisal of a stimulus or event with respect to the perceiver's goals or survival. In particular, the function, expression, and meaning of different emotions are hypothesized to be biologically distinct from one another. A theme common to many basic emotions theories is that there should be functional signatures that distinguish different emotions: we should be able to tell what emotion a person is feeling by looking at his or her brain activity and/or physiology. Furthermore, knowledge of what the person is seeing or the larger context of the eliciting event should not be necessary to deduce what the person is feeling from observing the biological signatures.[5]\n",
      " On \"constructionist\" accounts, the emotion a person feels in response to a stimulus or event is \"constructed\" from more elemental biological and psychological ingredients. Two hypothesized ingredients are \"core affect\" (characterized by, e.g., hedonic valence and physiological arousal) and conceptual knowledge (such as the semantic meaning of the emotion labels themselves, e.g., the word \"anger\"). A theme common to many constructionist theories is that different emotions do not have specific locations in the nervous system or distinct physiological signatures, and that context is central to the emotion a person feels because of the accessibility of different concepts afforded by different contexts.[7]\n",
      " For both theoretical and practical reasons researchers define emotions according to one or more dimensions. In his philosophical treatise, The Passions of the Soul, Descartes defines and investigates the six primary passions (Wonder, love, hate, desire, joy, and sadness). In 1897, Wilhelm Max Wundt, the father of modern psychology, proposed that emotions can be described by three dimensions: \"pleasurable versus unpleasurable\", \"arousing or subduing\", and \"strain or relaxation\".[8] In 1954, Harold Schlosberg named three dimensions of emotion: \"pleasantness–unpleasantness\", \"attention–rejection\" and \"level of activation\".[9]\n",
      " Dimensional models of emotion attempt to conceptualize human emotions by defining where they lie in two or three dimensions. Most dimensional models incorporate valence and arousal or intensity dimensions. Dimensional models of emotion suggest that a common and interconnected neurophysiological system is responsible for all affective states.[10] These models contrast theories of basic emotion, which propose that different emotions arise from separate neural systems.[10] Several dimensional models of emotion have been developed, though there are just a few that remain as the dominant models currently accepted by most.[11] The two-dimensional models that are most prominent are the circumplex model, the vector model, and the Positive Activation – Negative Activation (PANA) model.[11]\n",
      " The circumplex model of emotion was developed by James Russell.[12] This model suggests that emotions are distributed in a two-dimensional circular space, containing arousal and valence dimensions. Arousal represents the vertical axis and valence represents the horizontal axis, while the center of the circle represents a neutral valence and a medium level of arousal.[11] In this model, emotional states can be represented at any level of valence and arousal, or at a neutral level of one or both of these factors. Circumplex models have been used most commonly to test stimuli of emotion words, emotional facial expressions, and affective states.[13]\n",
      " Russell and Lisa Feldman Barrett describe their modified circumplex model as representative of core affect, or the most elementary feelings that are not necessarily directed toward anything. Different prototypical emotional episodes, or clear emotions that are evoked or directed by specific objects, can be plotted on the circumplex, according to their levels of arousal and pleasure.[14]\n",
      " The vector model of emotion appeared in 1992.[16] This two-dimensional model consists of vectors that point in two directions, representing a \"boomerang\" shape. The model assumes that there is always an underlying arousal dimension, and that valence determines the direction in which a particular emotion lies. For example, a positive valence would shift the emotion up the top vector and a negative valence would shift the emotion down the bottom vector.[11] In this model, high arousal states are differentiated by their valence, whereas low arousal states are more neutral and are represented near the meeting point of the vectors. Vector models have been most widely used in the testing of word and picture stimuli.[13]\n",
      " The positive activation – negative activation (P.A.N.A.) or \"consensual\" model of emotion, originally created by Watson and Tellegen in 1985,[17] suggests that positive affect and negative affect are two separate systems. Similar to the vector model, states of higher arousal tend to be defined by their valence, and states of lower arousal tend to be more neutral in terms of valence.[11] In the P.A.N.A. model, the vertical axis represents low to high positive affect and the horizontal axis represents low to high negative affect. The dimensions of valence and arousal lay at a 45-degree rotation over these axes.[17]\n",
      " Robert Plutchik offers a three-dimensional model that is a hybrid of both basic-complex categories and dimensional theories. It arranges emotions in concentric circles where inner circles are more basic and outer circles more complex. Notably, outer circles are also formed by blending the inner circle emotions. Plutchik's model, as Russell's, emanates from a circumplex representation, where emotional words were plotted based on similarity.[18] There are numerous emotions, which appear in several intensities and can be combined in various ways to form emotional \"dyads\".[19][20][21][22][23]\n",
      " The PAD emotional state model is a psychological model developed by Albert Mehrabian and James A. Russell to describe and measure emotional states. PAD uses three numerical dimensions to represent all emotions.[24][25] The PAD dimensions are Pleasure, Arousal and Dominance.\n",
      " Ethnographic and cross-cultural studies of emotions have shown the variety of ways in which emotions differ with cultures. Because of these differences, many cross-cultural psychologists and anthropologists challenge the idea of universal classifications of emotions altogether. Cultural differences have been observed in the way in which emotions are valued, expressed, and regulated. The social norms for emotions, such as the frequency with or circumstances in which they are expressed, also vary drastically.[26][27] For example, the demonstration of anger is encouraged by Kaluli people, but condemned by Utku Inuit.[28]\n",
      " The largest piece of evidence that disputes the universality of emotions is language. Differences within languages directly correlate to differences in emotion taxonomy. Languages differ in that they categorize emotions based on different components. Some may categorize by event types, whereas others categorize by action readiness. Furthermore, emotion taxonomies vary due to the differing implications emotions have in different languages.[26] That being said, not all English words have equivalents in all other languages and vice versa, indicating that there are words for emotions present in some languages but not in others.[29] Emotions such as the schadenfreude in German and saudade in Portuguese are commonly expressed in emotions in their respective languages, but lack an English equivalent. \n",
      " Some languages do not differentiate between emotions that are considered to be the basic emotions in English. For instance, certain African languages have one word for both anger and sadness, and others for shame and fear. There is ethnographic evidence that even challenges the universality of the category \"emotions\" because certain cultures lack a specific word relating to the English word \"emotions\".[27]\n",
      " Emotions are categorized into various affects, which correspond to the current situation.[30] An affect is the range of feeling experienced.[31] Both positive and negative emotions are needed in our daily lives.[32] Many theories of emotion have been proposed,[33] with contrasting views.[34]\n",
      " A 2009 review[44] of theories of emotion identifies and contrasts fundamental emotions according to three key criteria for mental experiences that:\n",
      " The combination of these attributes distinguishes emotions from sensations, feelings and moods.\n",
      " Researchers distinguish several emotion dynamics, most commonly how intense (mean level), variable (fluctuations), inert (temporal dependency), instable (magnitude of moment-to-moment fluctuations), or differentiated someone's emotions are (the specificity of granularity of emotions), and whether and how an emotion augments or blunts other emotions.[45] Meta-analytic reviews show systematic developmental changes in emotion dynamics throughout childhood and adolescence and substantial between-person differences.[45]\n",
      " \n",
      "The emotion annotation and representation language (EARL) proposed by the Human-Machine Interaction Network on Emotion (HUMAINE) classifies 48 emotions.[46] A tree-structured list of emotions was described in Shaver et al. (1987),[47] and also featured in Parrott (2001).[48]\n",
      " In 1980, Robert Plutchik diagrammed a wheel of eight emotions: joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger and anticipation, inspired by his Ten Postulates.[49][50] Plutchik also theorized twenty-four \"Primary\", \"Secondary\", and \"Tertiary\" dyads (feelings composed of two emotions).[51][52][53][54][55][56][57] The wheel emotions can be paired in four groups:\n",
      " There are also triads, emotions formed from 3 primary emotions, though Plutchik never describes in any detail what the triads might be.[58] This leads to a combination of 24 dyads and 32 triads, making 56 emotions at 1 intensity level.[59] Emotions can be mild or intense;[60] for example, distraction is a mild form of surprise, and rage is an intense form of anger. The kinds of relation between each pair of emotions are:\n",
      " Similar emotions in the wheel are adjacent to each other.[61] Anger, Anticipation, Joy, and Trust are positive in valence, while Fear, Surprise, Sadness, and Disgust are negative in valence. Anger is classified as a \"positive\" emotion because it involves \"moving toward\" a goal,[62] while surprise is negative because it is a violation of someone's territory.[63] The emotion dyads each have half-opposites and exact opposites:[64]\n",
      " MIT researchers [65] published a paper titled \"An Affective Model of Interplay Between Emotions and Learning: Reengineering Educational Pedagogy—Building a Learning Companion\" that lists six axes of emotions with different opposite emotions, and different emotions coming from ranges.[65]\n",
      " They also made a model labeling phases of learning emotions.[65]\n",

      "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. happiness,  in psychology, a state of emotional well-being that a person experiences either in a narrow sense, when good things happen in a specific moment, or more broadly, as a positive evaluation of one’s life and accomplishments overall—that is, subjective well-being. Happiness can be distinguished both from negative emotions (such as sadness, fear, and anger) and also from other positive emotions (such as affection, excitement, and interest). This emotion often co-occurs with a specific facial expression: the smile. People from around the world tend to have a similar concept of happiness and can recognize happiness in others. As a result, the specific emotion of happiness is often included as one of a small number of basic emotions that cannot be broken down into more fundamental emotions and that may combine to form other, more complex emotions (in fact, it is sometimes the only positive emotion that is considered to be basic). Thus, happiness is an important concept for researchers who study emotions. An entire field of research has developed around the more inclusive concept of subjective well-being, which is characterized by a broad collection of happiness-related phenomena rather than a specific momentary emotion. As one might expect, people who are happy in this way tend to experience frequent positive emotions and infrequent negative emotions. This broader form of happiness is not purely emotional, however: it also has a cognitive component. When happy people are asked to think back on the conditions and events in their lives, they tend to evaluate these conditions and events positively. Thus, happy people report being satisfied with their lives and the various domains in their lives. Interestingly, these different components of happiness do not always co-occur within the same person. It is possible that someone could experience a great deal of negative emotions yet still acknowledge that the conditions of his or her life are good ones. For example, someone who works with the poor, the sick, or the destitute may experience frequent negative emotions but may also feel satisfied with life because the work is worthwhile. Similarly, people who spend lots of time engaging in hedonistic pleasures may experience frequent momentary positive emotions, but they may also feel that life is empty and meaningless. Subjective well-being researchers are interested in the various factors that influence these distinct components. Psychologists are interested in happiness for two reasons. First, psychologists study happiness because laypeople are interested in happiness. When people from around the world are asked to list the things that are most important to them, happiness consistently tops the list. People rank attaining happiness as being more important than acquiring money, maintaining good health, and even going to heaven. Psychologists believe that they can help people achieve this goal of being happy by studying the factors that are associated with happiness. A second reason why psychologists study happiness is because a person’s evaluative responses to the world may provide information about the basic characteristics of human nature. One of the most basic principles guiding psychological theory is that people and animals are motivated to approach things in the world that cause pleasure and to avoid things in the world that cause pain. Presumably, this behavior results from adaptive mechanisms that guide organisms toward resources and away from dangers. If so, the evaluative reactions of many people about the world should be useful and revealing. For instance, some psychologists have suggested that human beings have a basic need to experience strong and supportive social relationships. They point to evidence from the field of subjective well-being to support their claim—a person’s social relationships are reliably linked to his or her happiness. Thus, cataloging the correlates of happiness should provide important information about the features of human nature. The results of scientific studies reveal several trends. For instance, when researchers ask people to report on their happiness, their answers tend to be consistent over time: people who say they are happy now also tend to say that they are happy when asked again in the future. Because the conditions in people’s lives don’t usually change that frequently, the stability of happiness measures provides support for the idea that these measures truly do tap this important construct. In addition, research shows that when life events do occur, people’s reports of happiness change in response. Perhaps more importantly, when psychologists try to assess happiness in a variety of different ways, these measures all seem to converge on the same answer. For instance, when researchers ask people to provide self-reports of happiness, they tend to agree with informant-reports of happiness—that is, ratings provided by friends and acquaintances. Furthermore, psychological tests—such as those that ask subjects to list as many positive memories as they can within a minute—may also determine who is happy without even asking for an explicit judgment of happiness, and, again, these measures tend to agree with self-reports. Psychologists can even find evidence of happiness in the brain: certain patterns of brain activity are reliably associated with happiness. When psychologists track people’s levels of happiness, most people report being in mildly positive moods most of the time. In addition, when psychologists ask people to rate their overall life satisfaction, most people report scores that are above neutral. This research finding is not limited to relatively well-off samples (like the college students who are often asked to participate in psychological studies). Instead, it has been replicated in many different populations in many nations around the world. Thus, when psychologists study the correlates of happiness, they are usually looking for factors that distinguish the very happy from the mildly happy rather than the happy from the miserable. Psychologists have arrived at several surprising conclusions in their search for predictors of happiness. Many of the factors that may first come to mind do not seem to play a major role in happiness. For example, although people strive to acquire high-paying jobs and dream about winning the lottery, income is not strongly correlated with happiness. Wealthy people are happier than poorer people, but the difference is not very large. As one might expect, the association between money and happiness is strongest among very poor groups and among poor countries. Income leads to smaller and smaller gains in happiness as income levels rise. Health also plays a role in subjective well-being, but the associations are, again, surprisingly small. Surveys of representative populations show that objective measures (including doctors’ reports, hospital visits, and lists of symptoms) are very weakly correlated with happiness. Subjective reports (such as a person’s own evaluation of his or her health) tend to correlate more strongly, but even these associations are, at most, moderate in size. In addition, although people with major health problems, such as paralyzing spinal-cord injuries, are quite a bit less happy than uninjured people, the difference is not as large as some might expect. Even people with very serious illnesses tend to report happiness scores that are above neutral. The factor that has been most closely linked to high levels of happiness is social relationships. Research consistently shows that people who have strong social relationships tend to report higher levels of well-being. As with other domains, subjective reports of relationship quality and relationship satisfaction tend to exhibit the highest correlations with subjective well-being. But even more objective measures, including the number of close friends a person has, the number of social organizations to which the person belongs, and the amount of time the person spends with others, all show small to moderate correlations with happiness. As one might expect based on this research, specific types of social relationships are also important for subjective well-being. For instance, marital status is one of the strongest demographic predictors of happiness. Married people consistently report higher levels of happiness than single people, who report greater happiness than the widowed, divorced, or separated. Interestingly, however, it does not appear that marriage itself causes higher levels of subjective well-being. Longitudinal studies show that people only receive a small boost in happiness around the time they get married, and they quickly adapt to baseline levels. The differences between married and unmarried people are due primarily to the lasting negative effects of divorce and widowhood, along with selection effects that might actually predispose happy people to marry. Other demographic characteristics also show weak associations with happiness. Religious people tend to report greater happiness than nonreligious people, though the size of these effects varies depending on whether religious beliefs or religious behaviors are measured. Factors such as intelligence, education, and job prestige are also only slightly related to well-being. Happiness does not seem to change dramatically over the course of the life span, except perhaps at the very end of the life when declines are somewhat steep. In addition, sex differences in subjective well-being are not large. In contrast to the relatively weak effects of external circumstance, research shows that internal factors play a strong role in subjective well-being. Individual differences in happiness-related variables emerge early in life, are stable over time, and are at least partially heritable. For instance, behavioral genetic studies show that identical twins who were reared apart are quite a bit more similar in their levels of happiness than are fraternal twins who were reared apart. This suggests that genes play an important role. Most estimates put the heritability of subjective well-being components at around 40–50 percent for positive emotional states and between 30–40 percent with respect to the negative emotional states of depression and anxiety. Personality researchers have shown that at least some of these genetic effects may be due to the influence of specific personality traits on happiness. For example, the stable personality trait of extraversion is moderately correlated with positive affect (that is, the feeling of a positive emotion) and, to a lesser extent, with life satisfaction and negative affect (that is, the feeling of a negative emotion). People who are outgoing, assertive, and sociable tend to report more intense and more frequent positive emotions. This association is so robust that some psychologists have even suggested that the two constructs—extraversion and positive affect—are controlled by the same underlying physiological systems. Similarly, researchers have shown that the basic personality trait of neuroticism is moderately to strongly correlated with negative affect (and again, to a lesser extent, with life satisfaction and positive affect). This and other research on the links between happiness and traits (including factors such as optimism and self-esteem) show that personality plays a strong role in people’s subjective well-being. There is a popular notion that the way that people view the world should influence their happiness. Some people always look for the silver lining in things, and presumably this positive outlook shapes the emotions that they feel. Psychologists, too, believe that the way that one thinks about the world is related to characteristic levels of happiness. A great deal of research has been conducted to examine the cognitive processes that affect a person’s subjective well-being. For instance, many researchers examine the role that social comparison processes play in happiness. Initially, psychologists thought that people evaluated the conditions in their own lives by comparing them with the conditions in other people’s lives. Those individuals who are worse off than the people around them (in other words, people who experience upward comparisons) should experience unhappiness; those individuals who are better off than the people around them (in other words, people who experience downward comparisons) would experience happiness. Although this effect can occur, other research suggests that the processes are a bit more complicated. For one thing, both upward and downward comparisons can lead to either increases or decreases in happiness. People may look to someone who is better off and think either that they are performing terribly in comparison or that the other person serves as an example of an achievement toward which they can strive. Obviously, these two interpretations should lead to different effects on happiness. In addition, research shows that happy and unhappy people often choose different people for comparison. Happy people may choose comparison people who serve to maintain their happiness; unhappy people may choose comparisons that lead to less happiness. Thus, social comparison affects happiness in complicated ways. Psychologists have also shown that goals and aspirations influence happiness. Not surprisingly, people who are rapidly approaching a goal tend to experience higher levels of happiness than people who are approaching a goal more slowly. But research also shows that simply having important goals is associated with greater happiness. Presumably, the sense of purpose that these goals create may protect people from the negative effects of temporary setbacks. Interestingly, the specific goals that people choose may also affect their happiness. Research suggests that choosing goals that are a challenge but not unachievable is important. Although people tend to think about happiness as an outcome that they desire rather than as a tool that can be used to achieve additional goals, psychologists have begun to ask what function happiness serves. One of the best known theories, developed by American psychologist Barbara Fredrickson in 1998, posits that the function of happiness (or more precisely, the function of positive emotions) is to broaden one’s thinking and to build one’s resources. According to this theory, positive emotions lead people to think creatively and to try new things. As a result, happy people can develop new ways to approach the world, new interests, new social relationships, and even new physical skills. All of these effects lead to positive outcomes in people’s lives. Psychologists have begun using experimental and longitudinal studies to determine whether positive affect plays a role in future positive outcomes. These studies provide evidence that happy people are more sociable and cooperative than unhappy people, are healthier than unhappy people, and earn more money than unhappy people. A number of studies have even shown that happy people live longer than unhappy people (and this is not just due to the fact that happy people tend to be healthy). Thus, although most people want to be happy because it feels good, this desired goal may lead to other positive outcomes in their lives.\n"

      " Sadness is not usually valued in our current culture. Self-help books promote the benefits of positive thinking, positive attitude, and positive behaviors, labeling sadness as a “problem emotion” that needs to be kept at bay or eliminated.   Evolution must have had something else in mind, though, or sadness wouldn’t still be with us. Being sad from time to time serves some kind of purpose in helping our species to survive. Yet, while other so-called “negative emotions,” like fear, anger, and disgust, seem clearly adaptive—preparing our species for flight, fight, or avoidance, respectively—the evolutionary benefits of sadness have been harder to understand…until recently, that is. With the advent of fMRI imaging and the proliferation of brain research, scientists have begun to find out more about how sadness works in the brain and influences our thoughts and behavior. Though happiness is still desirable in many situations, there are others in which a mild sad mood confers important advantages.  Findings from my own research suggest that sadness can help people improve attention to external details, reduce judgmental bias, increase perseverance, and promote generosity. All of these findings build a case that  sadness has some adaptive functions, and so should be accepted as an important component of our emotional repertoire. Here are some of the ways sadness can be a beneficial emotion. In one field study, we found that on rainy, unpleasant days that produce bad mood people had a much better recollection of details of objects they had seen in a shop. On bright, sunny days when people felt happy their memory was far less accurate in an identical situation. It seems that positive mood impairs, and negative mood improves attention and memory for incidental details in our environment. In another experiment, my colleagues and I showed participants a photo of either a car crash scene or a wedding party scene.  Later, we asked participants to recall happy or sad memories from their past, in order to shift their mood. They then received some questions about  the photos,  that were manipulated so that the questions either did or did not contain misleading or false information, such as “Did you see the stop sign at the scene?”—when there was no stop sign, only a yield sign. We later tested their eyewitness memory, and found that participants in a negative mood were better able to accurately remember original details, ignoring misleading information, while participants in positive moods made more mistakes. This experiment points to a basic psychological fact: What we remember about the past can be greatly altered by subsequent misinformation. It seems that negative mood reduces the likelihood that later false information will distort the original memory.  So, being in the right mood can help improve our recollections. Research like ours consistently finds that happiness can produce less focused and attentive processing and so increases the chances of misleading information being incorporated into memory, while a negative mood improves attention to detail and results in better memory. Humans constantly make social judgments, trying to read social cues in order to understand and predict others’ thoughts and behaviors. Unfortunately, these judgments can often be wrong, in part because of a number of shortcuts and biases that can lead us astray. We repeatedly find that people are more likely to make social misjudgments due to biases when they are happy. When happy or sad participants in one study were asked to detect deception in videotaped statements of people accused of theft (who were either guilty or not guilty), participants in negative moods were more likely to make guilty judgments— but they were also significantly better at correctly distinguishing between deceptive and truthful suspects. In another experiment, participants rated the likely truth of 25 true and 25 false general knowledge trivia statements, and, afterwards, they were told if each claim was actually true. Two weeks later, only sad participants were able to correctly distinguish between the true and false claims they had seen previously. Those in happier moods tended to rate all previously seen claims as true, confirming that a happy mood increases—and a sad mood reduces—the tendency to believe that what is familiar is actually true. \t Sad moods reduce other common judgmental biases, such as “the fundamental attribution error,” in which people attribute intentionality to others’ behavior while ignoring situational factors, and the “halo effect,” where judges tend to assume a person having some positive feature—such as a handsome face—is likely to have others, such as kindness or intelligence. Negative moods can also reduce another judgmental bias, primacy effects—when people place too much  emphasis on early information and ignore later details.  So negative mood can improve the accuracy of impression formation judgments, by promoting a more detailed and attentive thinking style.  When we feel happy, we naturally want to maintain that happy feeling. Happiness signals to us that we are in a safe, familiar situation, and that little effort is needed to change anything. Sadness, on the other hand, operates like a mild alarm signal, triggering more effort and motivation to deal with a challenge in our environment.  Thus, people who are happier will sometimes be less motivated to push themselves toward action compared to someone in a negative mood, who will be more motivated to exert effort to change their unpleasant state. We put this to the test by showing participants either happy or sad films—and then assigning them a demanding cognitive task with many difficult questions. There was no time limit, which allowed us to measure their perseverance by assessing the total time they spent on the questions, the number they answered, and the number they answered correctly. We found participants who were happy spent less time, attempted fewer items, and scored fewer correct answers than did participants we put in a negative mood, who spontaneously made more effort and achieved better results. This suggests that a sad mood can increase and happy mood can reduce perseverance with difficult tasks, possibly because people are less motivated to exert effort when they already experience a positive mood. Sad mood in turn may increase perseverance as people see greater potential benefits of making an effort. In general, happiness increases positive interactions between people. Happy people are more poised, assertive, and skillful communicators; they smile more, and they are generally perceived as more likable than sad people. However, in situations where a more cautious, less assertive and more attentive communication style may be called for, a sad mood may help. In one study, participants who first viewed happy or sad films were unexpectedly asked to go and request a file from a person in a neighboring office. Their requests were surreptitiously recorded by a concealed tape recorder. Analyses showed that the sad mood produced more polite, elaborate, and hedging requests, whereas those in a happy mood used more direct and less polite strategies.  Why would this be? In uncertain and unpredictable interpersonal situations, people need to pay greater attention to the requirements of the situation to formulate the most appropriate communication strategy. They must be able to read the cues of the situation and respond accordingly. Sad people are more focused on external cues and will not rely solely on their first impressions, which happy people are more inclined to trust. In other experiments, we found that people in a sad mood are also more persuasive, produce more effective and concrete arguments to support their position, and are better able to convince others than are people in a positive mood. Here’s another example: In social science experiments, researchers use the ultimatum game to study things like cooperation, trust, and generosity. They give players money and tell them to allocate as much as they want to another person who has the power to accept or reject the offer. If the offer is rejected, neither side gets anything. Past research has found that those in the giver role are not simply driven by maximizing benefits for themselves. However, the impact of mood on such decisions has not  been previously measured. My colleagues and I asked participants to play the ultimatum game after they’d been induced to feel happy or sad. We measured how long it took for them to make their allocation decisions and how much they gave. Those in sad moods gave significantly more to others than did happy people and took longer to make their decisions, suggesting that they paid greater attention to the needs of others and were more attentive and thoughtful in making their decisions.  In addition, when researchers looked at receivers in the game, they found that those in a sad mood were also more concerned with fairness, and rejected unfair offers more than did those in the happy condition In other words, mood can also influence selfishness and fairness.   Though much has been made of the many benefits of happiness, it’s important to consider that sadness can be beneficial, too. Sad people are less prone to judgmental errors, are more resistant to eye-witness distortions, are sometimes more motivated, and are more sensitive to social norms. They can act with more generosity, too. The benefits of sadness have their limits, of course. Depression—a mood disorder defined, at least in part, by prolonged and intense periods of sadness—can be debilitating. And no one is suggesting that we should try to induce sadness as a way of combating memory decline, for example. Research does not bear out the benefits of doing this. But my research does suggest that mild, temporary states of sadness may actually be beneficial in handling various aspects of our lives. Perhaps that is why, even though feeling sad can be hard, many of the greatest achievements of Western art, music, and literature explore the landscape of sadness. In everyday life, too, people often seek ways to experience sadness, at least from time to time—by listening to sad songs, watching sad movies, or reading sad books.  Evolutionary theory suggests that we should embrace all of our emotions, as each has an important role to play under the right circumstances. So, though you may seek ways to increase happiness, don’t haphazardly push away your sadness. No doubt, it’s there for good reason. Joseph P. Forgas, Ph.D., is a professor of psychology at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

      " Sadness is not usually valued in our current culture. Self-help books promote the benefits of positive thinking, positive attitude, and positive behaviours, labeling sadness as a “problem emotion” that needs to be kept at bay or eliminated. Evolution must have had something else in mind, though, or sadness wouldn’t still be with us. Being sad from time to time serves some kind of purpose in helping our species to survive. Yet, while other so-called “negative emotions,” like fear, anger, and disgust, seem clearly adaptive—preparing our species for flight, fight, or avoidance, respectively—the evolutionary benefits of sadness have been harder to understand…until recently, that is. With the advent of fMRI imaging and the proliferation of brain research, scientists have begun to find out more about how sadness works in the brain and influences our thoughts and behaviour. Though happiness is still desirable in many situations, there are others in which a mild sad mood confers important advantages. Findings from my own research suggest that sadness can help people improve attention to external details, reduce judgmental bias, increase perseverance, and promote generosity. All of these findings build a case that sadness has some adaptive functions, and so should be accepted as an important component of our emotional repertoire. Here are some of the ways sadness can be a beneficial emotion: 1) It can improve your memory. On rainy, unpleasant days that produce a blue mood, people have a much better recollection of details of objects. On bright, sunny days when people feel happy, their memory is far less accurate. It seems positive mood impairs, and negative mood improves attention and memory for incidental details in our environment. 2) It improves your judgment. People are more likely to make social misjudgments due to biases when they’re happy. But sad moods reduce common judgmental biases, such as attributing intentionality to others’ behaviour while ignoring situational factors, and assuming that a person having some positive feature—such as a handsome face—is likely to have others, such as kindness or intelligence. 3) It’s motivating. Happiness signals to us that we are in a safe, familiar situation, and that little effort is needed to change anything. Sadness, on the other hand, operates like a mild alarm signal, triggering more effort and motivation to deal with a challenge. In other words, a sad mood can increase and happy mood can reduce perseverance with difficult tasks. 4) It might improve your interactions. Sad people are more focused on external cues and don’t rely solely on their first impressions to formulate the most appropriate communication strategy in uncertain social circumstances. Happy people, on the other hand, are more inclined to trust their first impressions. 5) It can make you nicer. People in sad moods are more concerned with fairness, and after taking longer to decide, give significantly more to others than do happy people. This suggests that they pay greater attention to the needs of others and are more attentive and thoughtful in making their decisions. There is a bit of a cliché that “If you feel it, you can heal it.” Thoughts are fast moving, elusive, and hard to pin down. Sensations, though, are different. They are ponderous and slow moving, which means we can target them with our attention and tend to them with kindness and compassion. Locating the arising of sadness in the body (it is different in everyone) gives us a kind of steady place to direct our kind attention and begin to alter our relationship with sadness. Follow this sequence. 1) Ask yourself: How does sadness actually feel in my body? This makes it less of an abstract concept or purely mental event and more of an all-body-and-mind experience. 2) See if you can locate a place where sadness is most noticeable. Take your time with it. It might be in your head or face or in your heart; maybe it feels like a weight on your shoulders, or an ache in your belly. 3) Try mentally “breathing” into that location (visualizing that you are ventilating it with fresh air), touch it warmly with your hand, or simply incline your attention toward it like you would incline toward a sleeping infant. 4) Let go of the need to make the feeling go away. Let it be there moment by moment and allow it to do what it does. Perhaps it is simply saying, in its own way, “This moment is not what you wanted, but it’s the only one you’ve got.” This article appeared in the February 2017 issue of Mindful magazine alongside a feature titled, “A Time to Be Sad.” “5 Ways Sadness Can Be Good for You” was adapted from Greater Good, the online magazine of UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, one of Mindful’s partners. View the original article.

      "What is happiness? It seems like an odd question, but is it? Do you know how to define happiness? Do you think happiness is the same thing to you as it is to others? What’s the point of it all? Does it even make a difference in our lives? In fact, happiness does have a pretty important role in our lives, and it can have a huge impact on the way we live our lives. Although researchers have yet to pin down the definition or an agreed-upon framework for happiness, there’s a lot we have learned in the last few decades. This article will dive into the science of happiness, what it actually is, and why it matters. Before you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Happiness & Subjective Wellbeing Exercises for free. These detailed, science-based exercises will help you or your clients identify sources of authentic happiness and strategies to boost wellbeing.  First, let’s take a look at the definition of happiness so we’re all on the same page. Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of “happiness” is a simple one: “The state of being happy.” Not exactly what we were looking for, was it? Perhaps we need to dive a little deeper. Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of “happy” is a little more helpful: “Feeling or showing pleasure or contentment.” That’s better! So, happiness is the state of feeling or showing pleasure or contentment. From this definition, we can glean a few important points about happiness: Now we have a better grasp on what happiness is—or at least, how the Oxford English Dictionary defines what happiness is. However, this definition is not the end-all, be-all definition of happiness. In fact, the definition of happiness is not a “settled” debate.\n",

      " These detailed, science-based exercises will equip you or your clients with tools to discover authentic happiness and cultivate subjective well-being. By filling out your name and email address below.  The meaning of happiness in Positive Psychology really depends on who you ask. Happiness is often known by another name in positive psychology research: subjective wellbeing, or SWB. Some believe happiness is one of the core components of SWB, while others believe happiness is SWB. Regardless, you’ll frequently find SWB used as a shorthand for happiness in the literature. And speaking of the literature, you will find references to SWB everywhere. A quick Google search for the word “happiness” offers over 2 million results (as of January 6th, 2019). Further, a scan for the same term in two of psychology’s biggest online databases (PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES) returns 19,139 results from academic and other journals, books, dissertations, and more. With so many takes on happiness, it’s no wonder that happiness is a little difficult to define scientifically; there is certainly disagreement about what, exactly, happiness is. According to researchers Chu Kim-Prieto, Ed Diener, and their colleagues (2005), there are three main ways that happiness has been approached in positive psychology: Although they generally all agree on what happiness feels like—being satisfied with life, in a good mood, feeling positive emotions, feeling enjoyment, etc.—researchers have found it difficult to agree on the scope of happiness. However, for our purposes in this piece, it’s enough to work off of a basic definition that melds the OED‘s definition with that of positive psychologists: happiness is a state characterized by contentment and general satisfaction with one’s current situation. With the close ties between pleasure and happiness, you might be wondering how to differentiate between them. After all, the OED definition of happiness describes it as a state of feeling pleasure! The association between the two makes sense, and it’s common to hear the two words used interchangeably outside of the literature; however, when it comes to the science of positive psychology, it is important to make a distinction between the two. Happiness, as we described above, is a state characterized by feelings of contentment and satisfaction with one’s life or current situation. On the other hand, pleasure is a more visceral, in-the-moment experience. It often refers to the sensory-based feelings we get from experiences like eating good food, getting a massage, receiving a compliment, or having sex. Happiness, while not a permanent state, is a more stable state than pleasure. Happiness generally sticks around for longer than a few moments at a time, whereas pleasure can come and go in seconds (Paul, 2015). Pleasure can contribute to happiness, and happiness can enhance or deepen feelings of pleasure, but the two can also be completely mutually exclusive. For example, you can feel a sense of happiness based on meaning and engagement that has nothing to do with pleasure, or you could feel pleasure but also struggle with guilt because of it, keeping you from feeling happy at the same time. Happiness and meaning have an even more distinct line between the two. Rarely are happiness and meaning confused or used interchangeably, and for good reason—they describe two very different experiences. Humans may resemble many other creatures in their striving for happiness, but the quest for meaning is a key part of what makes us human, and uniquely so. Roy Baumeister et al. (2013) Unlike happiness, meaning is not a fleeting state that drifts throughout the day; it’s a more comprehensive sense of purpose and feeling of contributing to something greater than yourself. As the quote from Baumeister and colleagues (2013) suggests, there are important distinctions between the methods of searching for and the benefits of experiencing happiness and meaning. Scott Barry Kaufman at Scientific American (2016) outlines these distinctions that Baumeister and his fellow researchers found between the two: Basically, although the two overlaps and each can contribute to the experience of the other, the two can be mutually exclusive (Baumeister et al., 2013). Relevant reading: 19 Cliché Happiness Quotes & The (Lack Of) Science Behind Them According to Etymology Online (n.d.), the word for “happy” in most languages came from the word for “lucky.” This suggests an interesting trend—perhaps our ancestors believed that happiness was largely a by-product of luck? It also points to a possible difference of general opinion between earlier generations and our own 20th and 21st-century generations: that happiness was not a vital factor in a good life, but essentially a bonus that some lucky individuals got to experience. Here’s what author Darrin McMahon writes about the origins and root words of the word “happiness:” “It is a striking fact that in every Indo-European language, without exception, going all the way back to ancient Greek, the word for happiness is a cognate with the word for luck. Hap is the Old Norse and Old English root of happiness, and it just means luck or chance, as did the Old French heur, giving us bonheur, good fortune or happiness. German gives us the word Gluck, which to this day means both happiness and chance.” (McMahon, 2006) Although the term is not used very often, “self-happiness” refers to a sense of happiness or satisfaction with one’s self. It is often associated with self-confidence, self-esteem, and other concepts that marry “the self” with feeling content and happy. In general, it means that you are pleased with yourself and your choices, and with the person that you are. Happiness can be defined as an enduring state of mind consisting not only of feelings of joy, contentment, and other positive emotions, but also of a sense that one’s life is meaningful and valued (Lyubomirsky, 2001). Happiness energizes us and is a highly sought after state of being. But, what components make up happiness? Martin Seligman (2002) argued that happiness has three dimensions that can be cultivated:  Although each dimension is important, the happiest people tend to be those who pursue the full life— they infuse their life with pleasure, engagement, and meaning (Seligman et al., 2005). Building on Seligman’s three dimensions of happiness, Sirgy and Wu (2009) added the balanced life dimension. According to these authors, balance in life is another key factor contributing to happiness because the amount of satisfaction derived from a single life domain is limited. One needs to be involved in multiple domains to satisfy the broad spectrum of human needs. As a result, cultivating a sense of balance is crucial for juggling these life domains.  Now that we know what happiness is, let’s dive a little deeper. What does psychology have to tell us about happiness? There are many different theories of happiness, but they generally fall into one of two categories based on how they conceptualize happiness (or well-being): Some theories see happiness as a by-product of other, more important pursuits in life, while others see happiness as the end-goal for humans. Some theories state that pursuing happiness is pointless (although pursuing other important experiences and feelings may contribute to greater happiness), and some assume that happiness can be purposefully increased or enhanced. Although they differ on the specifics, these theories generally agree on a few points: Taking together all the various theories and findings on happiness, we know that there are at least a few factors that are very important for overall happiness: All of these factors can contribute to a happy life, but research has found that good relationships are a vital ingredient (Waldinger & Schulz, 2010). When we are happy in our most important relationships (usually our spouse or significant other, our children and/or our parents, other close family members, and our closest friends), we tend to be happier. We have some control over how our relationships go, so that leads us to an interesting and important question: can we increase our own happiness? The answer from numerous studies is a resounding YES—you CAN learn how to be happier. The degree to which you can increase your happiness will vary widely by which theory you subscribe to, but there are no credible theories that allow absolutely no room for individual improvement. To improve your overall happiness, the most effective method is to look at the list of sources above and work on enhancing the quality of your experiences in each one of them. For example, you can work on getting a higher salary (although a higher salary will only work up to about $75,000 USD a year), improve your health, work on developing and maintaining high-quality relationships, and overall, find ways to incorporate more positive feelings into your daily life. This does assume basic access to safety as well as social equality.  Given our definitions, what does a happy life look like? Of course, what it looks like will depend on the individual—a happy life for one person may be another’s nightmare! However, there are a few examples that can display a wide range of lives that can be conducive to happiness: Each of these was pulled from real-world examples of people who are happy. They may not seem like they have it all, but they all have at least one of the ingredients from the list of sources mentioned earlier. We don’t need to have everything we want in order to be happy—true happiness can be obtained by finding joy in what we already have, however much or little that may seem. What are some visions you associate with happiness? Are there any similarities with these dreams?  You might be wondering why happiness is considered such an important aspect of life, as there are many components of a meaningful life. In some ways, science would agree with you. It appears that life satisfaction, meaning, and well-being can be linked with happiness, but happiness is not necessarily the overarching goal for everyone in life. It is still important because it has some undeniably positive benefits and co-occurring factors. June Silny at Happify outlines 14 answers to the question, “What’s so great about happiness, anyway?” As you can probably assume from the list above, there is a strong relationship between mental health and happiness! When happy people are healthier, have better relationships, make friends more easily, and find more success in life, it’s easy to see why happiness and mental health are related. The sources that contribute to happiness are the same as those that provide people with a buffer or protection against mental illness, which explains the close relationship between the two. A recent study explored the association between happiness and mental health in college students and found that a relatively strong, positive correlation connects the two factors (Shafiq, Nas, Ansar, Nasrulla, Bushra, & Imam, 2015). This correlation held, even when gender and socio-demographic variables were added to the mix. The close tie between mental health and happiness is reason enough to make happiness an important priority for parents, educators, researchers, and medical professionals alike, along with the simple fact that we all like to feel happy!

      "I’m so glad I found this article to be honest. I disagree with your comment that ‘Happiness is not a state but a trait.’ I see happiness as a purely internal construct. I choose to be happy regardless of the people or things going on around me. Those people who look for happiness in others, outside of themselves, bounce back and forth between some fleeting form of happiness and unhappiness. If they would instead see happiness as an internal construct, man vs himself, they wouldn’t be dependent on someone else for their personal feelings of happiness. Because really, you don’t have the power to change others… But you do have all the power you need to change how you choose to see and react to what’s around you.  The ball of your happiness is 100% in your court. The article was very helpful and informative Just finished your article on happiness, or SWB and meaning . As stated in your article, happiness is fleeting and subject to feel good material goods and personal objectives. Having sex,  kids, buying a new car, an opioid response. However, I thought life was supposed to have meaning that would contribute to my happiness.  I chose a career based on what I thought I could contribute to my own and others lives. Rather naïve on my behalf and futile at this stage. I’m 72 years old and understand less now about the world as it is than ever before. I’ve seen the horrors of war and have moved forward from those days to marrying, having a family and building a career, the dopamine response, however I’ve lost the meaning of life and find myself unhappy, angry, reclusive and frustrated. I have done drugs, tried meditation and read books searching for meaning and happiness, which has been elusive at times.  Your article helped put certain expectations of others and myself in perspective and what I need to do to achieve happiness and meaning. Thank you! Thanks for this article.\n",

      "This chapter is about happiness during different life stages and of those in different generations. It is not the first time we have looked at happiness by age and gender.[1] But it is the first time we have enough survey years to start separating the life course from the ever-changing patterns of history. Some important parts of life are tied mainly to age, such as schooling, employment and health. Others depend more on what is going on in society and the world. These society-wide factors range from violence, earthquakes and pandemics to how new technologies and changing natural and social environments interact with also-changing ways of seeing history, facing inequalities, and connecting with each other. While most of our analysis deals with life at different ages, we bring in generational effects where we find them most salient. Our early sections relate to happiness as measured by life evaluations and emotions, showing their levels and changes for the younger (<30), the older (60+), and those in between divided into two groups, aged 30-44 and 45-59. For our later analysis by generation, we make a three-way split: those born before 1965, 1965-1980, and after 1980. Although the best separation points for generational differences will differ from country to country, depending on their key events, our separation does match some widely used definitions,[2] and also divides the sample fairly evenly, with roughly 30% in each of the first two groups, and 40% in the youngest cohort, which includes millennials and their successors. We start by presenting our usual ranking and modelling of national happiness of the population as a whole. In Figure 2.1 we rank countries by their average life evaluations over the three preceding years, 2021-2023. We have two versions of Figure 2.1. The first version presents actual life evaluations alone on centre stage. We include horizontal whiskers showing the 95% confidence bands for our national estimates, supplemented by a measure for each country of the range of rankings within which its own ranking is likely to be. The second version includes bars showing how much each of the six variables explains each country’s average life evaluation. We also present the latest version, in Table 2.1, of the equation we use to explain how and why life evaluations vary among countries and over time. Subsequent sections look separately at the life evaluations for the young, the old, and those in between, compare country rankings for each age group, and show how life evaluations at different ages have changed from a base period[3] of 2006-2010 to the three most recent years, 2021-2023. We then consider differences among age groups in the levels and trends of positive and negative emotions, proceeding from there to the important topic of inequality. We show that inequality of well-being is generally greater at higher age (perhaps due to differences in health status increasing more among people as individuals age), and has been increasing in all age groups in most global regions. In the subsequent sections of the chapter, we consider differences by generation as well as by age. In the first of these sections we return to one of the most striking findings in our two previous reports: the sharp increase, in every global region, of benevolent acts in 2020 and after, relative to their levels in the three pre-COVID years 2017-2019. This year we ask whether there have been differences in the extent to which different generations stepped to help others during the pandemic. We then use new evidence from the Gallup/Meta global state of social connections survey included in the 2022 round of the Gallup World Poll for 140 countries to show how generational differences in feelings of social support, loneliness, and being socially connected relate to six types of reported social interactions and to overall life evaluations. Finally, we return to international differences in life evaluations at different agesand in different generations. We assess the extent to which the often-found U-shape in age is present or absent across the globe, how these results have changed between 2006-2010 and 2021-2023, and attempt to separate the age-related changes from generational ones. The concluding section highlights our key results. Our measurement of subjective well-being continues to rely on three main well-being indicators: life evaluations, positive emotions, and negative emotions (described in the report as positive and negative affect). Our happiness rankings are based on life evaluations, as the more stable measure of the quality of people’s lives. Life evaluations. The Gallup World Poll, which remains the principal source of data in this report, asks respondents to evaluate their current life as a whole using the image of a ladder, with the best possible life for them as a 10 and worst possible as a 0. Each respondent provides a numerical response on this scale, referred to as the Cantril ladder. Typically, around 1,000 responses are gathered annually for each country. Weights are used to construct population-representative national averages for each year in each country. We base our usual happiness rankings on a three-year average of these life evaluations, since the larger sample size enables more precise estimates. Positive emotions. Positive affect is given by the average of individual yes or no answers about three emotions: laughter, enjoyment, and interest (for details see Technical Box 2). Negative emotions. Negative affect is given by the average of individual yes or no answers about three emotions: worry, sadness, and anger. Comparing life evaluations and emotions: Countries are ranked according to their self-assessed life evaluations (answers to the Cantril ladder question in the Gallup World Poll), averaged over the years 2021-2023.[4] The overall length of each country bar in Figure 2.1 represents the average response to the ladder question. The confidence intervals for each country’s average life evaluation are shown by horizontal whiskers at the right-hand end of each country bar. Confidence intervals for the rank of a country are are shown as part of the online version of Figure 2.1.[5] These ranking ranges are wider where there are many countries with similar averages, and for countries with smaller sample sizes.[6] The online version Figure 2.1 also includes colour-coded sub-bars in each country row, representing the extent to which six key variables contribute to explaining life evaluations. These variables (described in more detail in Technical Box 2) are GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption. As already noted, our happiness rankings are not based on any index of these six factors. Rather, scores are based on individuals’ own assessments of their lives, in particular their answers to the single-item Cantril ladder life-evaluation question. We use observed data on the six variables and estimates of their associations with life evaluations to help explain the variation of life evaluations across countries, much as epidemiologists estimate the extent to which life expectancy is affected by factors such as smoking, exercise, and diet. Figure 2.1: Country Rankings by Life Evaluations in 2021-2023 Two features carry over from previous editions of the World Happiness Report. First, there is still a lot of year-to-year consistency in the way people rate their lives in different countries, and since our rankings are based on a three-year average there is information carried forward from one year to the next. In the case of cataclysmic events happening during a particular year, their effect on the rankings will depend on when the survey took place, and will be muted by the three-year averaging. In the case of the October 7th attack on Israel and the subsequent war between Israel and Hamas, the survey in Palestine took place earlier in the year and the Israel survey after the hostage taking but before much of the subsequent warfare. Life evaluations fell sharply in Israel, by 0.9 on the 10-point scale, only one-third of which will enter the three-year averages discussed below. (See the Statistical Appendix for individual country trajectories on an annual basis, plotted separately by age group and by generation).[8] Second, there remains a large gap between the top and bottom countries, a full six points (on the 0 to 10 scale) between Finland at the top and Afghanistan at the bottom. The top countries are more tightly grouped than the bottom ones. The top twenty countries all fall within 1 point of each other, compared with a 2.5 point spread among the bottom twenty. The remaining 100-odd countries cover the remaining 2.5 points of the total range. This means that relatively modest changes in a national average can lead to a large shift in ranks, as illustrated by the 95% confidence region exceeding 25 ranks for several countries in the middle of the global list. Happiness scores are based on the resident populations in each country, rather than their citizenship or place of birth. In World Happiness Report 2018 we split the responses between the locally and foreign-born populations in each country and found the happiness rankings to be essentially the same for the two groups.[9] There was some footprint effect after migration, and some tendency for migrants to move to happier countries, so that among 20 happiest countries in that report, the average happiness for the locally born was about 0.2 points higher than for the foreign-born. How have the rankings changed since last year? While the top ten countries remain largely unchanged, there has been much more action in the top twenty. Costa Rica and Kuwait are both new entrants[10] to the top 20, at positions 12 and 13. The continuing convergence in happiness levels between the two sides of Europe led last year to Czechia and Lithuania being in the top twenty, nearly joined now by Slovenia in 21st place. The new entrants are matched by the departures of the United States and Germany from the top 20, dropping from 15 and 16 last year to 23 and 24 this year. The top countries no longer include any of the largest countries. In the top ten countries only the Netherlands and Australia have populations over 15 million. In the whole of the top twenty, only Canada and the United Kingdom have populations over 30 million. In Table 2.1 we present our latest modelling of national average life evaluations and measures of positive and negative emotions (affect) by country and year.[11] The results in the first column explain national average life evaluations in terms of six key variables: GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and freedom from corruption.[12] Taken together, these six variables explain more than three-quarters of the variation in national annual average ladder scores across countries and years, using data from 2005 through 2023.[13] The six variables were originally chosen as the best available measures of factors established in both experimental and survey data as having significant links to subjective well-being, and especially to life evaluations.[14] The explanatory power of the unchanged model has gradually increased as we have added more years to the sample, which is now almost three times as large as when the equation was first introduced in World Happiness Report 2013. We keep looking for possible improvements when and if new evidence becomes available.[15] The second and third columns of Table 2.1 use the same six variables to estimate equations for national averages of positive and negative affect, where both are based on answers about yesterday’s emotional experiences (see Technical Box 2 for how the affect measures are constructed). In general, emotional measures, and especially negative ones, are differently and much less fully explained by the six variables than are life evaluations. Per-capita income and healthy life expectancy have significant effects on life evaluations,[16] but not, in these national average data, on positive emotions.[17] But the social variables do have significant effects on both positive and negative emotions. Bearing in mind that positive and negative emotions are measured on a 0 to 1 scale, while life evaluations are on a 0 to 10 scale, having someone to count on can be seen to have similar proportionate effects on positive and negative emotions as on life evaluations. Freedom and generosity have even larger associations with positive emotions than with the Cantril ladder. Negative emotions are significantly reduced by social support, a sense of freedom, and the absence of corruption. In the fourth column, we re-estimate the life evaluation equation from column 1, adding both positive and negative emotions to partially implement the Aristotelian presumption that sustained positive emotions are important supports for a good life.[18] The results continue to buttress a finding in psychology that the existence of positive emotions matters more than the absence of negative ones when predicting either longevity[19] or resistance to the common cold.[20] Consistent with this evidence, we find that positive affect has a large and highly significant impact in the final equation of Table 2.1, while negative affect has none. In a parallel way, we show in a later section of this chapter that the effects of a positive social environment are larger than the effects of loneliness in all age groups and generations. As for the coefficients on the other variables in the fourth column, the changes are substantial only on those variables – especially freedom and generosity – that have the largest impacts on positive affect. Thus we can infer that positive emotions play a strong role in supporting life evaluations, and that much of the impact of freedom and generosity on life evaluations is channelled through their influence on positive emotions. That is, freedom and generosity have large impacts on positive affect, which in turn has a major impact on life evaluations. The Gallup World Poll does not have a widely available measure of life purpose to test whether it also would play a strong role in support of high life evaluations. Notes: This is a pooled OLS regression for a tattered panel explaining annual national average Cantril ladder responses from all available surveys from 2005 through 2023. See Technical Box 2 for detailed information about each of the predictors. Coefficients are reported with robust standard errors clustered by country (in parentheses). ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels respectively. The variables we use in our Table 2.1 modelling may be taking credit properly due to other variables, or to unmeasured factors. There are also likely to be vicious or virtuous circles, with two-way linkages among the variables. For example, there is much evidence that those who have happier lives are likely to live longer,[21] and be more trusting, more cooperative, and generally better able to meet life’s demands.[22] This will double back to improve health, income, generosity, corruption, and a sense of freedom. Collectively, these possibilities suggest that we should interpret the observed relationships with some caution. Another possible reason for a cautious interpretation of our results is that some of the data come from the same respondents as the life evaluations and are thus possibly determined by common factors. This is less likely when comparing national averages because individual differences in personality and individual life circumstances tend to average out at the national level. To provide even more assurance that our results are not significantly biassed because we are using the same respondents to report life evaluations, social support, freedom, generosity, and corruption, we tested the robustness of our procedure by splitting each country’s respondents randomly into two groups (see Table 10 of Statistical Appendix 1 of World Happiness Report 2018 for more detail). We then examined whether the average values of social support, freedom, generosity, and absence of corruption from one half of the sample explained average life evaluations in the other half of the sample. The coefficients on each of the four variables fell slightly, just as we expected.[23] But the changes were reassuringly small (ranging from 1% to 5%) and were not statistically significant.[24] Overall, the model explains average life evaluation levels quite well within regions, among regions, and for the world as a whole.[25] On average, the countries of Latin America still have mean life evaluations that are significantly higher (by about 0.5 on the 0 to 10 scale) than predicted by the model. This difference has been attributed to a variety of factors, including some unique features of family and social life in Latin American countries.[26] In partial contrast, countries in East Asia have average life evaluations below predictions, although only slightly and insignificantly so in our latest results.[27] This may reflect, at least in part, cultural differences in the way people think about and report on the quality of their lives.[28] It is reassuring that our findings about the relative importance of the six factors are generally unaffected by whether or not we make explicit allowance for these regional differences.[29] We once again used the model of Table 2.1 to assess the overall effects of COVID-19 on life evaluations. If we add an indicator for the four COVID years 2020-2023 to our Table 2.1 equation, we find no net increase or decrease in life evaluations.[30] This suggests, in a preliminary way, that the undoubted pains of living through a pandemic were offset by increases in countervailing forces, such as the extent to which respondents had been able to discover and share the capacity to care for each other in difficult times. Figure 2.2 shows the happiness rankings for the young (under 30), and Figure 2.3 does the same for those over 60.[31] Figure 2.2: Ranking of Happiness - the Young (Age below 30): 2021-2023 Figure 2.3: Ranking of Happiness - the Old (age 60 and above): 2021-2023 As shown by Figures 2.2 and 2.3, country rankings for the young and the old are quite different, and systematically so. For example, Lithuania, a recent entrant to the overall top twenty, ranks number 1 for those under 30 compared to 44 for those over 60, underscoring the fact that convergence between the two halves of Europe has been driven mainly by the rising happiness of the young. Countries ranking highest for the old are generally countries with high overall rankings, but include several where the young have recently fared very poorly. To better illustrate the overall patterns of international differences in happiness at different ages, Table 2.2 shows for each country the ranking of its life evaluations for the whole population (in the first column) and then four age groups- under 30, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+. The two columns at the right hand side of the table show for each country the happiest and least happy ages. The countries are listed in order of 2021-2023 average life evaluations for the whole population, the same order as is used for Figure 2.1. Countries with very different rankings at different ages reflect something unusual, relative to the world average experience for each age group. For example, the four countries in the NANZ group - the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - all have rankings for the young that are much worse than for the old, with the biggest discrepancies in the United States and Canada where the gap is 50 places or more. As we shall see in the following sections, these gaps have mainly arisen since 2010, and probably involve some mix of generational and age effects. There are many more countries where the rankings for the young are more than 40 places higher than for the old, mainly in Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America. The biggest gap is in Croatia, where the ranking for the young is 66 places higher than for the old. There are gaps of 50 or more places for Bulgaria, Moldova, and Serbia, and between 40 and 50 places in Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Paraguay. There are clearly generational as well as age effects at play here as well, as the older populations of Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro bear the most scars from the early 1990s wars and genocide following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.[32] The ranking gaps are imperfect measures of the happiness gaps between the old and young, because the distribution of country averages is much more tightly spaced in the middle, where a small change in average happiness can translate to many ranks. There are fewer countries with large rank differences at both ends of the distribution, where the ranks are most consistent. A country at the top of the overall ranking has to have pretty high happiness in all age groups, while in the really unhappy countries there are no happy age groups. Thus to assess happiness at different ages it is better to look at the average reported happiness levels at different ages, as we now do. What is typical for happiness at different ages?[33] Figure 2.4 shows average life evaluations in the four age groups for the world as a whole and for each of ten regions, separately for males and females. For the world as a whole, in recent years, there is a gradual slight decline in average happiness as age increases.[34] As will be shown by Figure 2.5 and 2.6 in the next section, it has not always been thus, as in the early years of the Gallup World Poll (2006-2010) the young were the happiest group, followed by those over 60 and then those 30 to 44, with 45-59 as the least happy group. Figure 2.4 Happiness at different ages, 2021-2023 The first panel of Figure 2.4 displays a fairly flat global pattern of life evaluations across age groups, with the young on average happier than the old, and a slight gender difference favouring females.[35] This global average obscures a range of regional experiences. When considering the regional differences, and how they contribute to the global average, it is important to remember that every country has equal weight in the regional and global averages, so that the regions with more countries contribute correspondingly more to the global averages.[36] Considering the regions in the order shown in Table 2.4, Western Europe has an almost completely flat profile across the age groups, although Table 2.2 and Figures 2.2 and 2.3 show a variety of experiences within the region. For example, Norway, Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain are countries where the old are now significantly happier than the young, while Portugal and Greece show the reverse pattern. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe show much higher life evaluations for the young, with a steady decline across age groups thereafter, accumulating to a gap between the young and the old of more than a full point on the 0 to 10 scale. This pattern is slightly more pronounced for females than for males. The twelve countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States, with Russia and Ukraine as the largest, show a more muted pattern than in Central and Eastern Europe, and with a larger mid-life drop for males than for females. The ten countries of Southeast Asia, with Indonesia the largest and Singapore the smallest, show a declining structure of happiness across age groups and a gender difference favouring young females, with the largest contribution to this effect coming from Singapore. In South Asia, happiness is lowest in the middle age groups, especially for males, exposing a large middle age life evaluation gap favouring females, with a definite U-shape for males. In East Asia, there is a general slight downward tilt with age, with females happier than males in all age groups. In Latin America and the Caribbean, there is a general downward trend across ages less than 60, with an increase thereafter for females. Male and female happiness is equal under the age of 30, with a growing age gap thereafter favouring females. In North America, Australia and New Zealand, life evaluations in 2021-2023 were lowest among the young, rising gradually with age to be highest among the old. The age gap favouring the old is evident in all four countries, while being much larger in the United States and Canada. The only significant gender gap is in older middle age, favouring females. For the twenty countries of the Middle East and North Africa, by contrast, happiness is highest for the young, especially young females, and then falls steadily thereafter before rising again for females 60 and over. There is diversity within the region, with the gap favouring the young found especially in Israel, while being reversed in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, both of which have large numbers of foreign-born workers in their lower age groups. Averaging across more than 40 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, life evaluations are highest for the young, fairly similar in the two middle age groups, and then higher for males and lower for females in the 60+ age group. What about global differences within age groups? Within the group of those under the age of 30, average life evaluations drop significantly with age,[37] a finding that has echoes in Chapter 3 dealing with a broader range of evidence on adolescent and youth well-being. Within the global sample of those over 60, we find life evaluations rising with age, as is also found in the Indian evidence in Chapter 5.[38] For a global sample including both of the middle age groups, there is a negative influence from age and a positive one from age-squared, with an implied low point slightly below age 50.[39] Within the 30 to 44 age group, the age effect is generally down, with no sign of a low point within that age range. Within the 45 to 59 group, there is an implied U-shape in age, with an estimated low point just over 50 years of age. More on this later in the chapter. The most fine-grained national-level indication of how the quality of life has been changing in each country is provided in Figures 7 through 34 in the Statistical Appendix. Figures 7-20 plot for each country the year-by-year trajectories for life evaluations in each of the four age groups, and Figures 21-34 repeat the analysis with the population divided into three birth cohorts: those born before 1964, between 1965 and 1980, and after 1980. For the population as a whole, Figure 2.5 below shows for each country the change in happiness from 2006-2010 to 2021-2023. Seventeen countries have increases in average life evaluations of a full point or more, compared to seven countries with reductions of a point or more on the 0 to 10 scale. Among the larger gainers, there are several countries in Eastern Europe where the increases were more than one-third of their average happiness scores in 2006-2010. Some of the worst faring countries, especially Lebanon and Afghanistan saw their life evaluations halved from their base values. Figure 2.5: Changes in Happiness: from 2006-2010 to 2021-2023 Figure 2.6 returns to a regional focus to show how average life evaluations have changed between 2006-2010 and 2021-2023 for each of the ten regions, as well as for the average of all countries, for each of four age groups. Figure 2.6 Happiness changes from 2006-2010 to 2021-2023 Looking first at the global average across countries, life evaluations have improved very slightly in all age groups. Once again, this global average masks some very different regional trajectories. Happiness has generally increased for all age groups in East Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and the CIS, and fallen in South Asia, the NANZ group and the Middle East and North Africa. There are interesting age group differences within this general pattern. In Western Europe, life evaluations among the young are significantly lower in 2021-2023 than they were in 2006-2010, with a lesser drop in lower middle age and a small increase for those over 60. In Central and Eastern Europe, life has improved by a full point or more at all ages, especially in the middle age groups. Happiness continues to be much higher in the younger age groups, although by less now than in 2006-2010. The convergence of happiness levels in Central and Eastern Europe toward those in Western Europe has continued. For those under 30, this convergence is complete, as happiness levels for them are essentially equal in both halves of Europe. For those over 60, the gap between the two halves of Europe is about half of what it was in 2006-2010, while still being more than a full point in 2021-2023. Life evaluations have also risen for all age groups in the CIS countries, by on average half as much as in Central and Eastern Europe, even though starting a half-point lower in 2006-2020. Hence the increased gap between these two regional groups, especially so for the young and lower-middle age groups. For the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, happiness has decreased in all age groups, but especially for the young, so much so that the young are now, in 2021-2023, the least happy age group. This is a big change from 2006-2010, when the young were happier than those in the midlife groups, and about as happy as those aged 60 and over. For the young, the happiness drop was about three-quarters of a point, and greater for females than males. In the Middle East and North Africa, average life evaluations fell in all groups between 2006-2010 and 2021-2023, by almost twice as much for those over 60 and for those under 30. Thus there has been in the past dozen years a steepening of the age gradient favouring the young over the old. Finally, average life evaluations in Sub-Saharan Africa have not changed for those in the middle age groups, while rising slightly for both the young and the old. How do emotions differ by age? We shall first consider negative emotions and then positive ones, following the definitions in Technical Box 2. Figure 2.7 shows negative emotions in the years 2021-2023 by age, separately for females and males. For the world as a whole, the average frequency of the selected negative emotions is higher for females than males, with the gender gap growing slightly from the young to the old. Figure 2.7 Negative emotions by gender and age, 2021-2023 Looking across the regions, there is a mixed pattern. In Western Europe, negative emotions are relatively less frequent for males than females at all ages, and decline slightly with age for both males and females. Negative emotions in 2021-2023 were generally more frequent in Central and Eastern Europe than in Western Europe, have a slightly larger gender gap, and rise with age for both females and males, but by more for females than males. The same pattern repeats when moving to the CIS countries, with negative emotions more frequent at higher ages, and more for females than males. The three parts of Asia show quite different patterns. In Southeast Asia, negative emotions yesterday are more frequent for females than males for the two younger age groups, and less frequent for those over 60. In South Asia, negative emotions are more frequent than elsewhere in the world, especially at higher ages and for females. In East Asia, negative emotions are globally low, and show little difference by age and gender. In Latin America and the Caribbean, negative emotions are more frequent for females than males, especially in the middle age groups, and generally rise with age. The group including the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand shows a quite different pattern than elsewhere. Negative emotions are at all ages more frequent for females than males, especially for those under 30. In this region, unlike anywhere else except Western Europe, negative emotions are more frequent among the young and least frequent for the old. Negative emotions in SubSaharan Africa are equally frequent for males and females under the age of 30, and rise with age for both genders thereafter, by more for females than males. In the Middle East and North Africa, the biggest gender gap is in the middle age groups, flanked by rough gender equality for the young and old. We now consider changes in emotions between 2006-2010 and 2021-2023. As shown in Figure 2.8, negative emotions are more frequent now than in 2006-2010 everywhere, only slightly so in East Asia and both parts of Western Europe. The big exception is in Central and Eastern Europe, where there has been a drop in the frequency of negative emotions in all age groups, in contrast to the rest of the world, but consistent with the happiness convergence taking place within Europe. Increases in negative emotions have been most frequent in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, especially at higher ages. In Latin America there has been no increased frequency of negative emotions among those under 30, but a substantial increase in the older age groups. The CIS countries show a similar but somewhat muted pattern. There is the reverse pattern in the NANZ countries where negative emotions have increased more for the young than for the old. No other region shows negative emotions increasing more for the young than for the old. Figure 2.8 Negative affect levels by age 2006-2010 vs 2021-2023 As shown in Figure 2.9, positive emotions, which include laughter, enjoyment, and doing interesting things,[40] are based on experience the previous day, are almost everywhere more frequent in the youngest age groups, and are gradually less frequent at higher ages. The only exception is in the NANZ group of countries, which show a U-shape in age, with those 60+ having about the same frequency of positive emotions as those under 30. Age-related decreases in the frequency of positive emotions, coupled with increases in the prevalence of physical pain, encourage a deeper look at why life evaluations as a whole so frequently rise after a mid-life low. We do this in later sections. Figure 2.9 positive affect levels by age 2006-2010 vs 2021-2023 What about changes from 2006-2010 to 2021-2023? Figure 2.9 shows no change at the global level, except for those over 60 where positive emotions are now more frequent than before. The unchanged global average shows the net effects of differing regional patterns. The increased global frequency of positive emotions among those over 60 is driven by the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, and the CIS. In all other regions, positive emotions at all ages are either unchanged or lower in 2021-2013 than they were in 2006-2010. From the outset of our WHR research, we have emphasised the importance of the distribution of happiness. Research has shown that inequality of well-being has a bigger effect on overall happiness than does inequality of income.[41] This is, we think, because it is a broader and more encompassing measure. Inequality in the distribution of happiness reflects inequalities of access to any of the direct and indirect supports for well-being, including income, education, health care, social acceptance, trust, and the presence of supportive social environments at the family, community and national levels. People are happier living in countries where the equality of happiness is greater. The use of a 0 to 10 scale for life evaluations permits us to measure inequality as the standard deviation of each country’s distribution - the bigger the average gap between the happier and less happy people, the higher will be our inequality measure.[42] This is the first report to consider equality of happiness by age group, set in a global environment of increasing inequality. At the global level, averaged across all ages and regions, inequality of happiness has increased by more than 20% over the past dozen years. This is shown in the world panel of Figure 2.10. Figure 2.10 Inequality of Happiness by age group, time and region The red line in each panel of Figure 2.10 shows the most recent values for happiness inequality in each group, with the grey line showing inequality by age group in 2006-2010. Inequality of happiness, as measured by the standard deviation of life evaluations within an age group, has increased in every region, except in Western Europe, where it has on average remained constant, with an increase in inequality among the old being offset by a drop for the young. In the North America plus ANZ group, inequality has increased for the young but not for the old. Every other region has seen inequality increases for the old that have been greater than those for the young, sometimes by very large amounts, as in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Happiness inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased by more than 50% for all age groups, and only slightly less so for those of middle age than for the old and the young. In light of the diverse regional trends for inequality at different ages, the overall inequality rankings by age are not the same as they were a dozen years ago. Inequality among those over 60 is now greatest in Latin America, followed closely by Sub-Saharan Africa, then, significantly lower, by Southeast and South Asia, followed then by the Middle East and North Africa, the CIS countries, and East Asia. Both halves of Europe, and the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand group currently have the lowest levels of inequality, without significant age-group differences. For those under 30, inequality of happiness is by far the greatest in Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by South Asia, MENA, Latin America and the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and MENA. Although happiness inequality among the young has grown, it is still lowest in Western Europe, as it was in our base period of 2006-2010. We updated last year the startling finding in World Happiness Report 2022 that all three benevolent actions surveyed in the Gallup World Poll - donations, volunteering and especially the helping of strangers - showed remarkably large increases over their pre-pandemic values. Now we can expand on those results in two important ways, first by adding a fourth year of COVID experience and second by seeing the extent to which benevolence levels and post-COVID frequencies differ by generation. There has been much discussion about possible shifts of values, including benevolence, from one generation to the next since the middle of the last century. In particular, in the US context the millennials have been alternatively called the ‘me generation’, the ‘we generation’ or just another generation.[43] With almost twenty years of data from the Gallup World Poll, it is becoming feasible to decouple the age of respondents from their year of birth, with the latter defining which generation they represent. These data permit us to make a more global assessment of generational shifts in benevolent actions. In addition, the COVID pandemic provided a natural experiment to capture generational differences in benevolence. It has been argued that greater levels of social trust among older than among younger Americans was likely to represent mainly a generational effect rather than a consequence of the ageing process.[44] There have also been studies, based on smaller samples of data, of whether benevolent values have shifted from one generation to the next, and whether they have changed over time within a given cohort.[45] All three of our benevolence measures can be interpreted as proxy measures of the quality of community-level social capital. How these behaviours were altered by COVID for people in different generations provides a nice test of generational differences. If there has been a generational shift, with those born more recently being less inclined towards benevolent acts, then we would expect to find that the surge in benevolence we have found would be larger among those in earlier generations. If the increases in benevolence have been equally or more present in recent generations, then that is an encouraging finding. Either there has not been a significant generational shift towards less societal connection, or possibly it has been offset by more recent positive generational shifts or masked by the inability of sheltered-in-place older adults to perform the benevolent acts they would otherwise have liked to do. To sort out these possibilities, it is useful to compare the pre-pandemic and COVID-era frequencies of benevolent acts by birth cohort. To do this, we divide respondents into three cohorts: those born before 1965 (Boomers and their predecessors), those born between 1965 and 1980 inclusive (Gen X), and those born after 1980 (Millennials and Gen Z). Figure 2.11 shows the percentage of the population performing the three benevolent acts by each of these birth-year cohorts, with grey bars showing the 2017-2019 values and the red bars the frequencies in and after 2020.[46] Figure 2.11 Frequency of benevolent acts by generation, before and since COVID For all cohorts, both before COVID and now, the helping of strangers is most frequent, followed by donations and then volunteering. The pre-COVID generational patterns differ for the three acts. The helping of strangers was most common among the younger cohorts, and lowest for those born before 1965, perhaps reflecting in part their lesser ability to be out and about. Charitable donations were less frequent in the younger generations than for the other age groups, perhaps reflecting their lower disposable incomes. Volunteering was fairly equal in the three generations. These data do not show levels that would suggest a generational shift to less social engagement, although there remains the problem of separating age and cohort effects. For that purpose, the COVID experience provides a very useful natural experiment. The post-COVID increases are large in both size and statistical significance for all three birth cohorts and all three benevolent acts. For all three acts, the increases in benevolence, whether measured as shares of the population, or percentage increases from pre-pandemic levels, are greatest for millennials and Gen Z, suggesting that millennials are even more likely than their predecessors[47] to increase their benevolent acts when a new need like COVID arises. In any event, the difference between generations in their responses is dwarfed by the general size of the increases in all generations. These benevolence results, if we compare 2017-2019 to 2020-2023, apply in every global region.[48] This increased benevolence provides an important part of our explanation for the relative stability of life evaluations during COVID. The chance to help those in need, and to see others doing the same, serves to give purpose and increase trust in the benevolence of others, all of which is associated with higher ratings of life as a whole.[49] There is widespread concern, especially in the United States, about an emerging epidemic of loneliness, and about the consequences of loneliness for mental and physical health.[50] In World Happiness Report 2023 we showcased the Gallup/Meta social connections and loneliness data from seven large countries[51] representing six global regions. We found that in all of the seven countries, feelings of social support were generally twice or more prevalent than feelings of loneliness. In subsequent use of the seven-country data, we have found that what respondents thought about the trustworthiness and kindness of others were very strong supports for overall satisfaction with social relations.[52] This year we are able to provide full global coverage, since some of the social connections variables were included in the 2022 Gallup World Poll, and can be analysed using data for 140 countries.[53] We developed separate measures for each of our three generations, thus bringing the Gallup/Meta data directly to bear on how these important relations vary by generation. Also valuable are data on the reported frequency of six types of social interactions. These permit us to compare the extent of social interaction with reported feelings of loneliness and social support, and see how they are correlated with our key overall life evaluation, the Cantril ladder. Figure 2.12 shows regional averages of individual responses for each of the three generations. The first column shows how socially supported respondents feel using four response possibilities, with ‘not-at-all’ coded as 0 and ‘very’ as 1.0.[54] The second column reports on feelings of loneliness, using the same scale. Strong social support is generally two times as prevalent as loneliness. The third column turns to the reported average frequency of six types of social interactions, including those with family and friends, at work, school, community groups, neighbours and strangers. Figure 2.12 Social Support, Loneliness, and Social Interactions by Generation Globally, perceived social support is highest in East Asia, Western Europe and the NANZ countries, and lowest in South Asia, especially in the intermediate age groups. The age gradient favours the old in Western Europe and the NANZ countries, and the young in Central and Eastern Europe, mirroring what was found earlier for life evaluations. Loneliness, when measured on the same scale as social support, is in all regions generally half as prevalent as social support. It displays somewhat matching patterns, being low where social support is high, and vice versa. Only in Southeast Asia, Western Europe and the NANZ countries is loneliness significantly higher for the Millennials than for the Boomers, a pattern that is reversed in Central and Eastern Europe. An earlier study found age to be the most important factor in explaining loneliness differences among survey respondents in the United States.[55] They found a peak in loneliness at age 20, with a steady age-related decline thereafter. This same phenomenon is evident in the Gallup/Meta data for the group of four countries including the United States. Although overall levels of loneliness are not unduly high in global terms,[56] there is a significantly different pattern across the generations. Loneliness is almost twice as high among the Millennials than among those born before 1965.[57] Millennials also feel less socially supported than Boomers in those countries, another place in which these countries look different from the rest of the world. This is despite the fact that actual social connections are much more frequent for Millennials than Boomers, and about as frequent as for Generation X. Do the high prevalence of loneliness and the lesser feelings of social support help to explain the very large ranking disparities between the old and young for the NANZ countries shown in Figures 2.2 and 2.3, and in Table 2.2? To some extent yes, but they can only be part of the story. If we add the three variables of Figure 2.12 to our preferred[58] individual-level equation, all three variables add very significantly to explaining life evaluations in 2022, the year in which the social connections data were collected. Feelings of social support are the most important, followed by loneliness and social interactions.[59] If those under 30 in the NANZ region had the same feelings of loneliness and social support as those over 60, their average life evaluations would be predicted to be higher by slightly more than one-tenth of a point on the 0 to 10 scale, about one-seventh of the happiness gap between those under 30 and those 60 and older in that region. Another interesting feature of the Gallup/Meta results, applicable in all global regions, is that the oldest members of the population, those in the boomer and earlier generations, feel more socially supported and less lonely than those in the younger generations despite having less frequent actual interactions with all groups except neighbours. This ability to gain more perceived support with fewer interactions likely helps to explain why life satisfaction so often rises after middle age even as the frequency and seriousness of health problems increases. We turn now to consider these issues in more detail. Our international rankings and trends of life across life stages show big differences. How does our evidence relate to the many studies of the U-shape in life evaluations frequently found in Western Europe and North America? The Gallup World Poll provides the largest set of countries ever available to study the generality of the U-shape in age. As suggested by the name, the U-shape describes a situation where there is a mid-life low in life satisfaction, with most findings placing the low point at about 50 years of age.[60] The first major age-related study with Gallup World Poll data[61] used evidence from 2006-2010. The study found a U-shape in the high-income English speaking countries, accompanied by a flat profile in Africa and life evaluations falling with age in Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Latin America. In this chapter we start with evidence from the same early years of Gallup World Poll data used in the earlier analysis, and then repeat the analysis using the three most recent years, allowing us to see the extent that age patterns for life evaluations have changed in the past fifteen years. Most studies of life evaluations based on large samples of survey data include both age and age-squared among their variables, with the almost universal finding being a negative coefficient on age and a positive one on age-squared. The relative sizes of these two coefficients can be used to calculate the low point in the estimated relationship, usually found to be about 50 years of age.[62] These age effects are sometimes estimated with other variables in the equation, and sometimes not, with the differences in the estimated age of minimum happiness depending on what other variables are included, but generally found to be similar to those based on the age terms alone. For this chapter, we first look at the effects of age alone, without including other variables, and without forcing any particular functional form for the relationship, echoing what was done in World Happiness Report 2015, where we examined the global distribution of life evaluations and emotions by country, region, age and gender.[63] We then turn later to confirming the generality of this sort of curvature after allowing for our full set of variables linked to life evaluation differences among individuals and among countries. We find as well that significant U-shape patterns persist even after allowing for generational differences. In this chapter we are first interested in knowing the happiest and least happy age groups in each country. For this purpose it is helpful to have the in-between group split into low-middle (30-44) and high-middle (44-59) groups, because the high-middle group includes the most commonly estimated low points for happiness.[64] We consider a country to exhibit a U-shape in age if average life evaluations in either of the two middle-age groups are below those for both the young and the old. Table 2.3 shows the number of countries in each global region according to which age group was the least happy using data from 2021-2023. Globally the old age group is the least happy in about half of the countries, the young the least happy group in seven countries, with the remaining countries having a mid-life low, most of them in the 45 to 60 age range. So by this definition the U-shape is currently found in almost half of our countries. It is currently evident in more than half the countries of Asia and Africa, and less than half in Europe and Latin America. In Western Europe the unhappiest age groups are diverse: one-third each for those below 30, 60+, and those in between. In all of the countries in Central and Eastern Europe and in two-thirds of the CIS countries those 60 and older are the least happy. In the NANZ group the reverse holds true, with the young and the early middle age groups being the least happy. How do these results compare with those revealed by the Gallup World Poll data for 2006-2010, as shown in the Statistical Appendix? There have been remarkable changes over the past dozen years, especially in Africa, where for the continent as a whole the old were the least happy group in 24 of the 34 counties in the 2006-2010 data, compared to just over one-third now. Latin America shows a similar pattern, with unhappy-old countries being much less numerous now than in 2006-2010. There are also fewer unhappy-old countries in Western Europe now than earlier, while in Eastern Europe and the CIS the change has gone in the reverse direction, with more unhappy-old countries now than previously. The overall drop since 2006-2010 in the number of unhappy-old countries has been offset by an increase in the number of unhappy-young countries, and in the 30-44 age group. Thus the U-shape in age is more prevalent now than it was a dozen years ago, when it was present in just a third of the countries. We show below that this change in patterns by age may be linked in part to generational shifts favouring earlier generations over the millennials and their successors. The most interesting questions for us relate not to whether a U-shape exists but whether and why these patterns differ from one country or time period to another.[65] The life satisfaction evidence is matched by other evidence of a mid-life crisis.[66] Many factors influencing life evaluations differ in prevalence for people at different ages, and may matter more at one stage of life than another. Self-assessed health status provides a striking example. The relevant individual-level Gallup World Poll question asks respondents whether they have health problems,with the possible answers being yes or no. The national level for this variable is thus the share of respondents in that age group who have health problems. This proportion rises strikingly across our three main age groups, trebling from under 15% for those under 30 to more than 45% for those over 60. There is also a difference among the age groups in how much having health problems affects life evaluations. As shown by our individual level global modelling in the Statistical Appendix, the damage to life evaluations from having a health problem rises from 0.3 for those under 30 to about 0.45 for those in the middle age groups, and 0.6 for those 60 and over. Thus not only the prevalence but also the well-being consequences of health problems are greater for those over 60. Putting these two differences together suggests that the impact of health problems on average life evaluations rises from 0.045 for those under 30 to 0.3 for those 60 and over, a sixfold increase.[67] Given the general downward influence of health problems on the life evaluations of the old, what helps to explain their greater happiness? One reason may simply be a lessening of the often taxing need to balance the competing demands of work and family pressures. This hypothesis is supported by the slightly rising prevalence of freedom to make key life decisions, from 75% of respondents in the middle groups to 80% for those over 60. Such freedom is apparently valued even more highly by the old than by those in middle age, with a combined effect raising life satisfaction for those over 60 by about the same as it is pushed down from middle to old age by the increasing frequency and severity of health problems. Is there also perhaps something more fundamental in the ageing process that might help to explain the extent to which life evaluations can rise after middle age even if circumstances do not improve? That life evaluations can rise after middle age without any matching improvement in life circumstances is suggested by many studies that find a U-shape in age even when several important life circumstances are taken into account.[68] One possible explanation is provided by experiments showing an age-related increase in the relevance of positive over negative information in both perception and memory.[69] This increase in positivity occurs against a backdrop of a prevailing negative bias in the way people view and react to new information.[70] There is a growing strand of experimental research suggesting that, as people age, they generally attach more importance to remembering the positive aspects of their lives, and less to remembering the negative aspects.[71] This could help to explain why life evaluations rise with age, especially in countries where this transfer of attention is more likely. These are likely to be where a larger fraction of the population has the basic necessities of life, as suggested by evidence that the increase in positivity is greater where there are fewer externally imposed constraints.[72] Does the age-related increase in trust and positivity, accompanied by possible technological obsolescence, and age-related increases in dementia, mean that online scammers will more successfully target the elderly, and make them the major victims? Early studies of the effects of scamming concentrated on older victims, assuming them to be especially vulnerable.[73] Ten years ago there was a recognized lack of evidence comparing the scamming susceptibility of the young and the old.[74] That research gap is being filled, with results showing that although lesser mental capacities and technological smarts do increase susceptibility to scams, ageing can produce a trust that is greater but also wisely directed,[75] so that the older targets are more likely to be suspicious and less likely to fall for the scam than are the young.[76] There is also some evidence that changes in life evaluations as people age depend on their social environment. To feel a sense of belonging meets an essential human need.[77] Evidence shows a sense of community belonging to have a larger influence on life satisfaction and to be more prevalent at higher ages,[78] providing yet another explanation for life evaluations that rise at higher ages. Boomers and earlier generations are happier than Gen Xers, who are in turn happier than their 21st Century successors. Marriage and the family are important elements of the social context whose importance to happiness may vary by age. For example, it has been found that in some countries that normally exhibit a U-shape the protective effects of marriage and living together are greatest for those in the middle age group, so that the U-shape is flatter, and mid-life relatively happier for the married, a finding we have been able to confirm with our global data.[79] An age-related positivity effect also helps to explain our finding in previous World Happiness Reports that life evaluations among the old were maintained or even improved despite COVID morbidity and mortality being much higher for that age group.[80] Although age-related positivity research has mainly focused on positive and negative emotions, it clearly has implications for overall life evaluations, as illustrated by results reported above and elsewhere. As people age, the prevailing negativity bias of younger ages is on average across the world increasingly offset as age leads people to focus more on positive news and memories, to accumulate enriching life experiences,[81] to think better of others, and to rate their lives more highly. We can now exploit the growing number of years of Gallup World Poll data to attempt to separate the effects of age from those of being in a particular generation. For example, the changes in age patterns that we have found when comparing 2006-2010 with 2021-2023 may reflect generational shifts as well as age. To assess those possibilities, we have used our individual-level data to estimate happiness equations (as shown in Table 12 in the Statistical Appendix) showing a U-shape in age appearing in concert with generational shifts in average happiness, with the Boomers and earlier generations being happier than Gen Xers, who are in turn happier than Millennials and their 21st century successors.[82] These differences vary by region, of course, while across the globe the Millennials as a group, after taking into account their other life circumstances, have life evaluations that are about one-quarter of a point lower than the Boomers, with Gen X in between, but closer to the Millennials.[83] The U-shape in age continues to operate, both between and within generations. Within the boomer group, life evaluations rise with each extra year of age, while falling by a bigger annual amount for the Millennials.[84] The biggest change this year is within the top 20. There are two new entrants, Costa Rica and Kuwait at 12 and 13. Coupled with the continuing convergence between the two halves of Europe, with Czechia, Lithuania and Slovenia at positions 18, 19 and 21, have contributed to the fall of the United States and Germany from 15 and 16 last year to 23 and 24 this year. The top 10 have remained fairly stable, with Finland still in first position, although now followed more closely by Denmark. All of the top 10 countries, except for Australia and the Netherlands, have populations less than 15 million, while in the top twenty, only Canada and the United Kingdom have populations over 30 million. Rankings differ a lot for the young and the old. In some cases these favour the old, as in the United States and Canada, where the rankings for those aged 60 and older are 50 or more places higher than for those under 30. In other cases, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, the reverse is true, with many rankings being more than 40 places higher for the young than for the old. From 2006-2010 to 2021-2023 changes in overall happiness varied greatly from country to country, ranging from increases as large as 1.8 points (Serbia) to decreases as large as 2.6 points (Afghanistan). Central and Eastern Europe had the largest increases, of the same size for all age groups. Gains were half as large in the CIS countries. East Asia also had large increases, especially for the older population. By contrast, life evaluations fell in South Asia in all age groups, especially in the middle age groups. Happiness also fell significantly in the NANZ group, by twice as much for the young as for the old. There were also significant declines in the Middle East and North Africa, with larger declines for those in the middle age groups than for the old and the young. The convergence of happiness levels in Central and Eastern Europe toward those in Western Europe has continued. For those under 30, this convergence is essentially complete, as their happiness levels are now equal in both halves of Europe. For those ever 60, the gap between the two halves of Europe is about half of what it was in 2006-2010. But it is still very large, more than a full point in 2021-2023. In 2021-2023 negative emotions were in every region more prevalent for females than males, with almost everywhere the gender gap being larger at higher ages. The exception to this global pattern is provided by the small group of countries that includes the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where females under 30 have one-third more negative emotions than males, a gap that is smaller at higher ages. There is no corresponding gap in life evaluations, as the gender gap is small at all ages, and tends to favour females. Negative emotions are more frequent now than in 2006-2010 everywhere except East Asia and both parts of Europe. In Central and Eastern Europe, in contrast to the rest of the world, but consistently with the happiness convergence taking place within Europe, negative emotions are now less frequent in all age groups than they were in 2006-2010. Positive emotions have not changed much, while still remaining more frequent for the young than for older age groups. Global happiness inequality has increased by more than 20% over the past dozen years, in all regions and age groups, to an extent that differs a lot by age and by region. It has increased most for the old in Latin America, Southeast Asia and the CIS, and at all ages in SubSaharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa. The COVID crisis provided a natural experiment to compare the benevolence of different generations. The Post-COVID increases in benevolence, whether measured as shares of the population, or percentage increases from pre-pandemic levels, are large for all generations, but especially so for the Millennials and Generation Z, who are even more likely than their predecessors to help others in need. In almost every global region, as confirmed by the new Gallup/Meta global social connections data, comparably measured feelings of social support are more than twice as prevalent as loneliness. Both social support and loneliness affect happiness, with social support usually having the larger effect. Social interactions add to happiness, with their effects flowing through increases in social support and reductions in loneliness. The U-shape in age, with a mid-life low, is widespread, accompanied by a generational effect favouring earlier generations. Among those born before 1965, life evaluations rise with age, as also shown in Chapter 5. Among those born after 1980, happiness falls with each year of age, as also shown in Chapter 3. As between generations, after taking into account age and life circumstances, those born before 1965 (Boomers and their predecessors) have life evaluations about one-quarter of a point higher than those born after 1980 (millennials and gen Z).[85] Aknin, L.

(2015). ↩︎ Our groups follow the approximate demarcation lines between Boomers and their predecessors, Generation X, the Millennials (often called Gen Y) and Gen Z (those born 1995 or later. Our global data show that these Western-centric definitions do not apply to many of the key generational shifts we find, such as those before and after the collapse of the USSR, civil wars and genocides, and first and subsequent generations of migrants from one country to another. Generational differences have been highlighted in the workplace (Parry & Unwin 2011, Campbell et al. 2015), in voting behaviour (Van den Brug & Kritzinger 2012) and values more generally (Twenge et al. 2012). ↩︎ The base period also includes data collected from 27 countries in 2005, as the first round of the Gallup World Poll was divided between 2005 and 2006. Only one country, France, had surveys in both 2005 and 2006. Thus our base period includes all data collected before 2011. ↩︎ A country’s average answer to the Cantril ladder question is exactly equivalent to a notion of average underlying satisfaction with life under an assumption of “cardinality:” the idea that the difference between a 4 and a 3 should count the same as the difference between a 3 and a 2, and be comparable across individuals. Some social scientists argue that too little is known about how people choose their answer to the Cantril ladder question to make this assumption and that if it is wrong enough, then rankings based on average survey responses could differ from rankings based on underlying satisfaction with life (Bond & Lang, 2019). Other researchers have concluded that answers to the Cantril ladder question are indeed approximately cardinal (Bloem & Oswald, 2022; Ferrer-i-Carbonell & Frijters, 2004; Kaiser & Oswald, 2022; Krueger & Schkade, 2008). ↩︎ For any pair of countries, the confidence intervals for the means (depicted in Figure 2.1 as whiskers) can be used to gauge which country’s mean is higher than the other, accounting for statistical uncertainty in the measurement of each. The confidence interval for a country’s rank (given in Figure 2.1 as text) represents a range of possible values for the ranking of their mean among all countries, accounting for uncertainty in the measurement of all of the means (following Mogstad et al., 2024). The ranges are constructed so that the chance that the range does not contain the country’s true rank is no more than 5%. ↩︎ Not every country has a survey every year. The total sample sizes are reported in Statistical Appendix 1, and are reflected in Figure 2.1 by the size of the 95% confidence intervals for the mean, indicated by horizontal lines. The confidence intervals are naturally tighter for countries with larger samples. ↩︎ Countries marked with an * do not have survey information in 2023. Their averages are based on the 2021 and/or 2022 surveys. ↩︎ The actual average values for each survey year may be found in the online data file supporting the equations in Table 2.1. For Israel, the average ladder for 2021-2022 was 7.61, compared to 6.78 in 2023. The latter average, if compared to the three-year averages used for other countries, would put Israel 19th in the rankings. ↩︎ For detailed analysis of the life satisfaction of immigrants to the United Kingdom and Canada from many source countries of, see Helliwell et al. (2020). ↩︎ Costa Rica is actually a re-entrant, having also been in 12th position in WHR 2013. Kuwait was out of the rankings last year for lack of surveys during the three-year period, so its ranking in WHR 2024 is based only on the 2023 survey. ↩︎ The statistical appendix contains alternative forms without year effects (Appendix Table 9), and a repeat version of the Table 2.1 equation showing the estimated year effects (Appendix Table 8). These results continue to confirm that inclusion of year effects makes no significant difference to any of the coefficients. In these aggregate equations, adding regional or country fixed effects would lower the coefficients on relatively slow moving variables where most of the variance is across countries rather than over time, such as healthy life expectancy and the log of GDP. With equations based on individual observations, where income and health are measured by individual-level variables, adding country fixed effects makes little difference to any of the coefficients. ↩︎ The definitions of the variables are shown in Technical Box 2, with additional detail in the online Statistical Appendix. ↩︎ The model’s predictive power is little changed if the year fixed effects in the model are removed, with adjusted R-squared falling only from 0.757 to 0.753. ↩︎ The data and rankings for the 2021-2023 averages for the six variables are to be found in Figures 68-91 of the Statistical Appendix. The underlying annual data used in estimating the equations shown in Table 2.1 can be found in an online file accompanying the chapter. ↩︎ For example, unemployment responses at the individual level are available in most waves of the Gallup World Poll. While they show an effect size similar to that found in other research, the coefficient has never been significant in the country-level equation, and their inclusion does not influence the size of the other coefficients. ↩︎ Below, we use the term “effect” when describing the coefficients in these regressions; some caveats to this interpretation are discussed later in this section. ↩︎ In the equation for negative affect, healthy life expectancy takes a significant positive coefficient, despite its positive simple correlation with life evaluations in this aggregate dataset. This may be due to the fact that in the global sample there is a positive correlation between age and the frequency of reports of negative emotions. Countries with higher healthy life expectancies have respondents who are on average older, since the sample data are weighted to replicate the actual age shares of the population. ↩︎ This influence may be direct, as many have found, e.g. De Neve et al. (2013). It may also embody the idea, as made explicit in Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 2001), that good moods help to induce the sorts of positive connections that eventually provide the basis for better life evaluations. ↩︎ See, for example, the well-known study of the longevity of nuns, Danner et al. (2001). ↩︎ See Cohen et al. (2003), and Doyle et al. (2006). ↩︎ The meta analysis by Chida & Steptoe (2008) shows significant linkages from positive affect to health, independent of the effects of negative affect. For a recent survey of the links running from positive emotions and life evaluations to subsequent morbidity and mortality, see Pressman et al. (2019). ↩︎ The prevalence of these feedbacks was documented in Chapter 4 of World Happiness Report 2013, De Neve et al. (2013). ↩︎ We expected the coefficients on these variables (but not on the variables based on non-survey sources) to be reduced to the extent that idiosyncratic differences among respondents tend to produce a positive correlation between the four survey-based factors and the life evaluations given by the same respondents. This line of possible influence is cut when the life evaluations are coming from an entirely different set of respondents than are the four social variables. The fact that the coefficients are reduced only very slightly suggests that the common-source link is real but very limited in its impact. ↩︎ The coefficients on GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy were affected even less, and in the opposite direction in the case of the income measure, being increased rather than reduced, once again just as expected. The changes were very small because the data come from other sources, and are unaffected by our experiment. However, the income coefficient does increase slightly, since income is positively correlated with the other four variables being tested, so that income is now able to pick up a fraction of the drop in influence from the other four variables. We also performed an alternative robustness test, using the previous year’s values for the four survey-based variables. Because each year’s respondents are from a different random sampling of the national populations, using the previous year’s average data also avoids using the same respondent’s answers on both sides of the equation. This alternative test produced similarly reassuring results as shown in Table 13 of Statistical Appendix 1 in World Happiness Report 2018. The Table 13 results are very similar to the split-sample results shown in Tables 11 and 12, and all three tables give effect sizes very similar to those in Table 2.1 in the main text. Because the samples change only slightly from year to year, there was no need to repeat these tests with this year’s sample. ↩︎ Actual and predicted national and regional average 2021-2023 life evaluations are plotted in Figure 92 of the Statistical Appendix. The 45-degree line in each part of the Figure shows a situation where the actual and predicted values are equal. A predominance of country dots below the 45-degree line shows a region where actual values are below those predicted by the model, and vice versa. Southeast and South Asia provide the largest current example of the former case, and Latin America of the latter. ↩︎ See Rojas (2018). ↩︎ If special variables for Latin America and Southeast Asia are added to the equation in column 1 of Table 2.1, the Latin American coefficient is +0.49 (t=5.2) while that for Southeast Asia is -0.31 (t=2.3). Special variables for East Asia and South Asia are not significant. ↩︎ See Chen et al. (1995) for differences in response style, and Chapter 6 of World Happiness Report 2022 for data on regional differences in variables thought to be of special importance in Asian cultures. ↩︎ One slight exception is that the negative effect of corruption is estimated to be slightly larger (0.87 rather than 0.73), although not significantly so, if we include a separate regional variable for Latin America. This is because perceived corruption is worse than average in Latin America, and its happiness effects there are offset by stronger close-knit social networks, as described in Rojas (2018). The inclusion of a special Latin American variable thereby permits the corruption coefficient to take a higher value. ↩︎ More precisely, the test vehicle is the equation in column 1 with no year fixed effects, given our wish to compare the four COVID years to the preceding years. Aknin et al. (2022), in a study for the Lancet task force, used the high frequency COVID policy stringency data of Hale el al. (2021) and longitudinal survey data of well-being in 15 countries to show that COVID deaths and policy stringency both to have negative partial linkages to mental health, with the stringency effect being small and offset in many countries by the corresponding lower death rates. See also Bu et al. (2020). ↩︎ The corresponding rankings for the two intermediate age groups are in the Statistical Appendix. ↩︎ Although Rwanda is not in the current rankings, its data from earlier years also confirms that past internecine violence leaves bigger scars on the lives of those who lived through them. In Rwanda, the average life evaluation of those 60 and over is lower than that of those under 30 by nearly two-thirds of a point.This is in contrast to natural disasters, which have been shown, where initial levels of social trust are sufficiently high, to lead to subsequent increases as people reach out to help others in need. See, for examples, Toya & Skidmore (2014), Yamamura et al. (2015), Kang & Skidmore (2018), Dussaillant & Guzman (2014) and Aldrich (2011). And for COVID-19, see Bartscher et al. (2021), Bu et al. (2020), and the COVID death rate modelling in Helliwell et al. (2021). ↩︎ It has been argued that response styles of respondents (the extent to which they tend to give middling or end-point answers, for example) varies by age, and hence might influence conclusions about relative happiness at different ages (Stone et al. 2019). However, their evidence suggests the potential effects on life evaluations are not significant. See also Benjamin et al. (2023). Barrington-Leigh (2024) argues that differing use of focal points may be leading to underestimating the effects of education and income, while Nilsson et al. (2024) argue that the ladder framing of the Gallup life evaluation question may induce higher estimates of the effects of income and power. ↩︎ What is plotted here is the average across countries of each country’s average happiness in the age group in question. If we were instead to use the number of people in our global sample in each age group, we would show average happiness being greatest for those over 60, since those countries with greater longevity (and hence more people over 60) also have higher average happiness, for that and other related reasons. ↩︎ Montgomery (2022) studies gender differences in the ranking of life vignettes in the Gallup World Poll, finding a difference of about the same size as the average global ladder advantage for females, and hence a sufficient explanation for the global average gap. This is less likely to affect the analysis of differences among regions or over time. There is no matching vignette analysis available for the Gallup data on emotions. ↩︎ We have calculated and compared these ‘one-county-one-vote’ data with population-weighted averages in several earlier reports. The latter tend in some regions to reflect almost entirely the experience of the largest country in the region, and to depend on circumstances and measurement issues best studied on a national level rather than as part of a regional average. ↩︎ The drop is about .04 per year of age in the context of our full model specification,including country and year fixed effects. The drop is only slightly less without any control variables and is slightly greater for males than females. ↩︎ This evidence of life evaluations being higher at higher ages, even among those over 60 years of age, is not found in the earlier years of Gallup World Poll data for India, but is clearly evident in the surveys since 2016, the time period within which the Indian survey was fielded. In Chapter 5 of this volume, the average increase in SWL (on a 0 to 10 scale) is 0.012 per year. In a similar equation for all the global data from the Gallup World Poll, the increase is 0.008 per year. For the South Asian countries as a group the average annual increase is .023. As for other regions, the average annual increase is .025 in Latin America and in the NANZ group, .023 in SE Asia, .013 in East Asia, and approximately zero in Africa and all parts of Europe and the CIS. ↩︎ These equations are run with country fixed effects and the control variables used in the micro equations reported in the statistical appendix. ↩︎ The pattern of declining frequency of positive emotions is roughly the same for laughter, enjoyment and doing something interesting yesterday. It also applies if the sample is split by generation rather than age, reflecting the relatively high correlation between age and generation, due to the still limited number of years in our synthetic panel. ↩︎ See Goff et al. (2018). ↩︎ We cannot measure inequality for the positive and negative emotions because they are only available in the Gallup World Poll as binary yes/no answers about experiences yesterday. ↩︎ Twenge et al. (2012) summarise key papers presenting each of these alternative positions. Their own analysis modestly favours the ‘me generation’ view, except in the case of volunteering, where the evidence is more mixed. ↩︎ See especially Putnam (2000), where it was estimated the generational change “might account for perhaps half of the overall decline” (p.283) in civic engagement and social capital in the last third of the 20th century. See also Putnam (2020). ↩︎ Leijen et al. (2022) found benevolent values in 2020 to be similar in all generations in their longitudinal study of Dutch data. Their millennials started with a lower benevolence value in 2008, but this gradually rises to reach the average of the other generations by 2020. ↩︎ The sample makes use of the data from the 136 countries with surveys in at least five of the seven years spanning 2017-2023. The results are qualitatively similar if the analysis is done using only the 81 countries (as of mid-February 2024) with surveys reported for all seven years. This more restricted sample leaves out countries where surveys were not possible in 2020, the first year of the pandemic. ↩︎ For donations, the COVID-induced increases are similar in magnitude for all generations. ↩︎ If we compare the 2021-2023 data to the average of all previous Gallup years, then there are no increases in benevolence in the NANZ and Western European countries. That is because these countries, which have always had globally high levels of benevolent acts, but have seen significant drops over the past dozen years. Thus for them the COVID-induced growth in benevolence represented the reversal of a downward trend rather than an increase over the levels in 2006-2010. ↩︎ See Dolan et al. (2021) for COVID-related evidence, and more generally, Aknin et al. (2011), Helliwell et al. (2018), and Helliwell & Wang (2011). ↩︎ Murthy (2023), Holt-Lunstad et al.

(2024). ↩︎ See Gallup/Meta (2023) ↩︎ The intermediate answers ‘a little’ and ‘a lot’ are coded as 0.33 and 0.67 respectively, reflecting a linear conversion of the original 4-point response scale. This replicates the Likert scale are adopted in the Mate/Gallup (2022) study, transformed from the 1 to 4 scale to a 0 to 1 scale. ↩︎ See Shovestul et al. (2020). ↩︎ In 2022 it averaged 27% across all countries, and 21% for the four-country group including the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. ↩︎ With only a single year of data it is not possible to distinguish age and cohort effects. Those under 30 years of age (who are only have as numerous as the millennials+Gen Z) have a frequency of loneliness more than twice that for those 60 and over (who are very similar in number to the Boomers, and are hence the same people) ↩︎ In column 1 of Table 12 of the Statistical Appendix. ↩︎ The standardized betas for the three variables are .076, .053 and .036, respectively. The estimated coefficients are .623 (t=17.7) for feelings of social support, .456 (t=12.4) for feelings of loneliness, and .473 (t=8.5) for the reported frequency of social interactions. ↩︎ See, for example, Blanchflower & Oswald (2008) and Stone et al. (2010). ↩︎ Steptoe et al. (2015). ↩︎ The equation being estimated is y=a +b*age + c*age squared, The slope is b+2 c*age, equaling zero where b-2c*age=0, or at age=b/2c. If b is 100 times as large as c, then the age of minimum happiness is 50 years. The equation is often estimated using age and 100*age-squared in order to show more significant figures for c. In this case the low point is equal to 50 years if -c=b., and is less than 50 if -c>b. See Blanchflower (2021) for a survey of studies using this method, most of which produce minima within the 45-59 age range. ↩︎ Fortin et al. (2015). That chapter uses data from the beginning of the Gallup World Poll in 2005-2006 through most of 2014. ↩︎ See the review of recent estimates in Blanchflower (2021). ↩︎ In the same vein, see Graham & Ruiz Pozuelo (2017). ↩︎ For a wide-ranging review, see Giuntella et al. (2023). ↩︎ For the young, the effect is 0.15*0.30=0.045, while for the old it is 0.5*0.6=0.3. ↩︎ E.g. Blanchflower (2021). However, see another research stream (e.g. Gerstorf et al. 2010) that finds in some countries a sharp drop in subjective well-being as death becomes imminent. ↩︎ Charles et al. (2003) and Mather & Carstensen (2003). Zak et al. (2022) finds a corroborating age-related increase in oxytocin release. ↩︎ Baumeister et al. (2001) provide an influential review of many sorts of evidence that people perceive and react to the bad rather than the good, and prefer to avoid losses rather than to make gains. The authors argue that there is, or at least may once have been, an evolutionary advantage in doing so. ↩︎ See Reed et al. (2014) for a meta analysis of more than 100 experimental studies showing that events are seen in more positive terms at higher ages. ↩︎ According to the socioemotional selectivity theory advanced by Carstensen (2006) the positivity effect is likely to be absent for those who are constrained by experimental or life constraints. ↩︎ James et al. (2014), Burnes et al. (2017). ↩︎ Reed & Carstensen (2012). ↩︎ Mueller et al. (2020). ↩︎ Walzak (2023). ↩︎ Baumeister & Leary (1995). ↩︎ See Michalski et al. (2020) and Helliwell et al. (2019) ↩︎ See Anusic et al. (2014), Clark et al. (2021), Grover & Helliwell (2019) and Helliwell et al. (2019). Using our global model (from Table 12 in the Statistical Appendix) based on individual data for those under 50 years of age, we estimated equations for those who are married (or cohabiting) separately from the rest of the population. The estimated annual drop in life evaluations is one-third less for the married/cohabiting group. Thus the global data confirm the earlier findings based on data mainly from the UK and other countries in Western Europe. ↩︎ See Carstensen et al. (2020) for survey evidence showing robustness of the age-related positivity effect during COVID in a US sample. The authors argue that this robustness in the face of a highly salient and powerful threat tends to favour its generality. Some argue that this effect may be muted or reversed when death is imminent (Charles, 2010). ↩︎ Oishi and Westgate (2022) argue that a rich life, which prioritises curiosity and seeks challenges, has a value quite beyond happiness and meaning. They argue that such richness ‘grows over time in response to perspective-changing life experiences’ (Oishi & Westgate, 2022, p. 17). As such it is likely to provide an additional reason for life evaluations to rise at older ages. ↩︎ It requires a substantial number of years of data to attempt to identify separate effects for age, time and generation, as in a single year the three are linked by the identity whereby for each individual age+ year of birth = year. The ability to partition the effects among age, cohort and time is heavily dependent on the number of years, the selection of cohorts, and the functional forms used (Bell & Jones, 2018). Our identification attempt makes use of an established quadratic form for the effects of age on life satisfaction and a fairly well established split of respondents into three generational groups. It also includes fixed effects for each year. The results confirm the usual positive coefficient on age and a negative coefficient of age squared while delivering also highly significant generational coefficients, with t-values of about 10 for the intergenerational differences. Much of the increase in life satisfaction for those in the older age group is in this equation transferred from the age squared term to a generational advantage for the Boomers and, to a lesser extent, Gen X. ↩︎ See column 1 of Table 12. ↩︎ The annual rise for the Boomers is 0.006 (from column 4 of Table 12) while the annual fall for the Millennials is 0.029 (column 2 of Table 12). ↩︎ See column 1 in Table 12 of the Statistical Appendix. That equation includes country and year fixed effects, gender, age, age-squared, and individual-level counterparts to the six variables in the model of Table 2.1. The age effects within each generation are shown in columns 2 and 4 of Appendix Table 12. ↩︎ The World Happiness Report is a partnership of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the WHR’s Editorial Board.

      "Check out our latest tips for looking after your mental health. Happiness is a unique emotional experience for each of us, which can make it tricky to define.  If we are to speak generally, happiness can be summed up by two main components:  Happiness is more than the absence of sadness, as it speaks to our overall sense of purpose and satisfaction in life. We can experience happiness, while still feeling indifferent, disconnected or numb.      Whilst it’s important to recognise we cannot, and should not, be aiming to be ‘happy’ 100% of the time, our wellbeing is reliant on experiencing happiness from time to time. That is, experiencing positive, enjoyable emotions, and feeling connected to a sense of contentment in our lives. Experiencing happiness is important for our emotional and physical health.   A stronger sense of happiness and wellbeing has been shown to lead to better relationships, increase social connection and contribution to the lives of others, as well as contributing to healthier physical wellbeing.     Wellbeing is fundamental to our happiness and life satisfaction. Wellbeing is a combination of factors that make us feel physically, mentally, socially and emotionally healthy. On the other hand, happiness comes from within us. It is dependent on what we think, feel and do. This means we aren’t just a product of our genes and our circumstances, but we are active drivers in how happy we feel. We will all experience hardship at some point in our lives. It’s our response to it that makes the difference. Thankfully, we have the ability to break free from common traps or obstacles that are blocking our happiness by learning new coping skills. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)-based coping skills are taught in all of our treatment programs. Like the name suggests, CBT targets the cognitions (i.e. things you think) and behaviours (i.e. things you do) that contribute to conditions like stress, anxiety and depression. These skills teach you to how to respond to negative emotions in a healthy way.  Working on your happiness can contribute to your overall wellbeing – and the wellbeing of those around you.  There has been a lot of excellent research looking into happiness, how we experience it, and importantly, what we can do to build and maintain our own happiness and wellbeing.  Key strategies identified in the research body include:   It’s a real challenge that many of us are time-poor, with demands and responsibilities across our home and work-life that can sometimes feel never-ending. But it’s so important to prioritise time for the things that bring us connection, joy and happiness. The good news is, we can do this in creative ways each day even amongst the busyness of life.   Prioritising your happiness will mean you’re better equipped to face the day-to-day challenges when they arise, and connect us to purpose and meaning in our lives. It can help to look at your current routine and see if you can bring in mindfulness, enjoyment or self-care in a way that doesn’t add additional time. For example, can you call your friend or family during your morning commute to catch up? Can you enjoy a playlist of your favourite music whilst cooking dinner in the evening? Perhaps you can find one evening a week to try a new hobby?  It can also help to look at our lifestyle to see if there’s room to improve our happiness, for example, practice good sleep hygiene and regular sleep/wake times. Sometimes just making a small adjustment can improve our happiness. Start a gratitude journal: Reflecting on good things that happened in your day can give you an instant mood boost, no matter how big or small.  Extra sleep: Research from the University of Michigan found that getting just an extra hour of sleep every night will make you happier than earning a $60,000 raise for the year! If you’re struggling with sleep, take a look at our free Insomnia Program. Practise mindfulness: Short mindfulness practice every day can help us realise that we are not our thoughts or emotions. If you’d like to learn how to stay focused on the present moment, take a look at our free Mindfulness Program.  If you’re unsure of how you’re feeling today, you could try our anonymous Take-a-Test Tool to see which online program(s) might best suit your needs.    Interested in learning more? Practicing gratitude allows us to accept our current situation, appreciate the good qualities in ourselves (and others) and helps us to feel happier.  Stay in Touch!

      "Are you on the journey of seeking more joy in your life? Maybe you’ve found this blog, as in your healing journey, “more joy” is the beacon that gets you through the tough times, and you are fearlessly on the quest to learn more about trauma, anxiety and depression and how to support a more joyous life. If that sounds like you, then welcome, this post is for you, and if that doesn’t feel like you that’s okay too, I invite you to stay for a story. She sat on the couch across from me…she was so eternally wise, and self-aware. She had worked so hard to get to this place of understanding herself, but she still felt stuck and nowhere closer to her joyful, fulfilled life. She came back session after session, explaining her struggles and breaking down the gritty details of who she was, until one day I said, “Hey Ellie, is it okay if I slow you down and ask what you are feeling right now?” Ellie responded with haste, “well I’m feeling sad because of…” and trailed off into her explanation.  I paused her again in attempts to help her connect more with her emotional experience,  “Ellie, are you sad right now? Where is the sadness, is it with you, are you feeling it?” Ellie responded “well yeah I’m sad”, she paused, beginning to choke up not knowing what to say.  I chimed in with gentle support and a question that seemed to have changed everything for her. “Ellie, I hear you are sad and I can understand how hard it is to feel stuck in that sadness.  I’m curious how your body is holding onto that sadness, and perhaps if there is room for you to feel it? Can you just for a moment stay with that sadness?” For the first time in her therapy experience, Ellie was still, she took a moment to check inside and find her sadness…she was really being with her emotional experience. All of a sudden she felt her throat getting tighter, her heart sinking, and tears welling up in her eyes. She said, as she began to cry,  “ yeah I feel so sad because…” I so ever gently interrupted her again “hey Ellie it’s okay, can we just let the sadness be there, it's SO important why, and also its SO important to just feel, so just feel sad my dear”. Ellie, hearing this, felt her shoulders drop and soften in surrender, and spent the next minute or so letting her tears flow, crying, and being guided by me, to find support in her own breath and the pillows and blankets on the couch. This somatic release, was exactly what she needed.  She cried, while I held space, providing compassionate support and company, until Ellie felt a huge sense of relief wash over her body and exclaimed “woah that felt so cathartic, I feel lighter”.  I cracked a very stereotypical nerdy therapist joke and Ellie let out a HUGE chuckle, beginning  to laugh deep into her belly, and that feeling of lightness transformed into a moment of JOY! Could it be? Ellie settled into a feeling of calm after her chuckle with me and asked, “What just happened? For a moment there I felt so light and wow, I really laughed. Is that joy? How is that possible?” I then began to share a bit of on emotions….\"Let me explain the connection between our pain and joy. They might be more connected than you think!” However, it is common for people to try to avoid or suppress emotions such as sadness, anger, and fear.  They may try to explain it away, finding logical and “cognitive” ways to cope with the pain…. While this may seem like a reasonable strategy to avoid discomfort, it can actually have negative consequences, including a reduced ability to feel positive emotions. Our emotions are interconnected and interdependent, they are all processed in the same areas of the brain. The neural pathways that process pain are called the nociceptive pathways. The nociceptive pathways send signals to the brain's pain center, the somatosensory cortex, which processes the sensory information and generates the experience of pain.  This is because the somatosensory cortex does not just process sensory information related to pain; it also processes sensory information related to other physical sensations, such as touch, temperature, and pressure. When we experience pleasure and joy, these sensory signals are processed in the same way as pain signals. However, instead of activating the pain center, they activate the brain's pleasure center. This means that the same sensory channels in the brain can be activated by both pain and pleasure, but the experience we have depends on which part of the brain is activated. When the pain center is activated, we experience pain, and when the pleasure center is activated, we experience pleasure and joy. Pain and joy are actually closely related to each other, cousins if you will! In other words, our emotional experiences are not isolated events, but rather a complex and dynamic system of interrelated experiences. When we try to avoid or suppress our perceived negative emotions, we are essentially shutting down a part of our emotional experience. This can create a \"numbing\" effect, where we feel less overall emotion, both positive and negative.  Research has shown that people who struggle to identify or express their emotions, particularly painful ones, often experience lower levels of overall emotional experience, including positive emotions. This is because our ability to experience positive emotions is dependent on our ability to process and regulate negative emotions. By suppressing negative emotions, we may be hindering our ability to fully experience positive emotions. _____________________________ So, to wrap up this short story with a nice bow… Ellie was able to FEEL into her sadness, thus allowing her to FEEL into the depths of her own experience of joy. She was activating “stuck” pain and moving through the experience, using those key areas of the brain, so her JOY was fully expressed as well. If it feels too scary at first that's okay, maybe find a trusted friend or a therapist that can help support you in feeling safe  to express your emotions slowly, bit by bit, over time.  And If you are ready to lean into those heavier feelings, let them out, because the pain that you may be avoiding feeling, just might be the very thing you need to feel, to then welcome and unlock the feeling of JOY.

Or the last time you were so anxious about an upcoming event that you couldn’t concentrate for days? These types of emotions are unpleasant to experience and can even feel overwhelming. People often try to avoid them, suppress them or ignore them. In fact, in psychology experiments, people will pay money to not feel many negative emotions. But recent research is revealing that emotions can be useful, and even negative emotions can bring benefits. In my emotion science lab at Texas A&M University, we study how emotions like anger and boredom affect people, and we explore ways that these feelings can be beneficial. We share the results so people can learn how to use their emotions to build the lives they want. Our studies and many others have shown that emotions aren’t uniformly good or bad for people. Instead, different emotions can result in better outcomes in particular types of situations. Emotions seem to function like a Swiss army knife – different emotional tools are helpful in specific situations. Sadness occurs when people perceive that they’ve lost a goal or a desired outcome, and there’s nothing they can do to improve the situation. It could be getting creamed in a game or failing a class or work project, or it can be losing a relationship with a family member. Once evoked, sadness is associated with what psychologists call a deactivation state of doing little, without much behavior or physical arousal. Sadness also brings thinking that is more detailed and analytical. It makes you stop and think. The benefit of the stopping and thinking that comes with sadness is that it helps people recover from failure. When you fail, that typically means the situation you’re in is not conducive to success. Instead of just charging ahead in this type of scenario, sadness prompts people to step back and evaluate what is happening. When people are sad, they process information in a deliberative, analytical way and want to avoid risk. This mode comes with more accurate memory, judgment that is less influenced by irrelevant assumptions or information, and better detection of other people lying. These cognitive changes can encourage people to understand past failures and possibly prevent future ones. Sadness can function differently when there’s the possibility that the failure could be avoided if other people help. In these situations, people tend to cry and can experience increased physiological arousal, such as quicker heart and breathing rates. Expressing sadness, through tears or verbally, has the benefit of potentially recruiting other people to help you achieve your goals. This behavior appears to start in infants, with tears and cries signaling caregivers to help. Anger occurs when people perceive they’re losing a goal or desired outcome, but that they could improve the situation by removing something that’s in their way. The obstacle could be an injustice committed by another person, or it could be a computer that repeatedly crashes while you’re trying to get work done. Once evoked, anger is associated with a “readiness for action,” and your thinking focuses on the obstacle. The benefit of being prepared for action and focused on what’s in your way is that it motivates you to overcome what’s standing between you and your goal. When people are angry, they process information and make judgments rapidly, want to take action, and are physiologically aroused. In experiments, anger actually increases the force of people’s kicks, which can be helpful in physical encounters. Anger results in better outcomes in situations that involve challenges to goals, including confrontational games, tricky puzzles, video games with obstacles, and responding quickly on tasks. Expressing anger, facially or verbally, has the benefit of prompting other people to clear the way. People are more likely to concede in negotiations and give in on issues when their adversary looks or says they are angry. Anxiety occurs when people perceive a potential threat. This could be giving a speech to a large audience where failure would put your self-esteem on the line, or it could be a physical threat to yourself or loved ones. Once evoked, anxiety is associated with being prepared to respond to danger, including increased physical arousal and attention to threats and risk. Being prepared for danger means that if trouble brews, you can respond quickly to prevent or avoid it. When anxious, people detect threats rapidly, have fast reaction times and are on heightened alert. The eye-widening that often comes with fear and anxiety even gives people a wider field of vision and improves threat detection. Anxiety prepares the body for action, which improves performance on a number of tasks that involve motivation and attention. It motivates people to prepare for upcoming events, such as devoting time to study for an exam. Anxiety also prompts protective behavior, which can help prevent the potential threat from becoming a reality. There is less research on boredom than many other emotions, so it is not as well understood. Researchers debate what it is and what it does. Boredom appears to occur when someone’s current situation is not causing any other emotional response. There are three situations where this lack can occur: when emotions fade, such as the happiness of a new car fading to neutral; when people don’t care about anything in their current situation, such as being at a large party where nothing interesting is happening; or when people have no goals. Boredom does not necessarily set in just because nothing is happening – someone with a goal of relaxation might feel quite content sitting quietly with no stimulation. Psychology researchers think that the benefit of boredom in situations where people are not responding emotionally is that it prompts making a change. If nothing in your current situation is worth responding to, the aversive experience of boredom can motivate you to seek new situations or change the way you’re thinking. Boredom has been related to more risk seeking, a desire for novelty, and creative thinking. It seems to function like an emotional stick, nudging people out of their current situation to explore and create. People want to be happy. But research is finding that a satisfying and productive life includes a mix of positive and negative emotions. Negative emotions, even though they feel bad to experience, can motivate and prepare people for failure, challenges, threats and exploration. Pleasant or not, your emotions can help guide you toward better outcomes. Maybe understanding how they prepare you to handle various situations will help you feel better about feeling bad. \n",
